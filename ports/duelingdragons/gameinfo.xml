    <desc>In its search for power, humanity dug too deep. Cracking open the earth above an ancient nuclear waste tomb, radiation spread throughout the world, warped by centuries of rotting. Sorcerers and dragons were created by the radiation's twisted power, and soon dragon riders took to the skies and began terrorizing the planet.\n\nYou are an errant dragon rider on a quest to find and defeat the legendary Dragon Lord. Time your attacks well, gather new spells, and soar through the skies atop your dragon.</desc>
