Sorcerers and dragons were created by the radiation's twisted power, and soon dragon riders took to the skies and began terrorizing the planet.\n\nYou are an errant dragon rider on a quest to find and defeat the legendary Dragon Lord. Time your attacks well, gather new spells, and soar through the skies atop your dragon.",
