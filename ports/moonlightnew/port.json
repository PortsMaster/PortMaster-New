    "inst_md": "- Install the latest version of [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases) on your PC *(GFE is not updated anymore but may give good results for NVIDIA users)*\n- This guide will use the windows installer version. \n- Run the installer, agree with the terms. Wait for it to finish.\n- Open Sunshine for the first time. It will open up a window in your default browser.\n- It may give a warning about your connection not being private. Click on advanced and continue to localhost.\n- Here you will set the username and password for Sunshine, set it to something simple and memorable. It will ask for it every time.\n- The page will reload and then you will log into Sunshine. \n- Now its time to open Moonlight on your handheld. \n- First head to the *\"Settings Menu\"* and set them how you would like. Preferably start off with a low bitrate and your devices native resolution and framerate. \n- Lets move to the *\"Connect Menu\"*. Here you will first set your host device IP-address. \n- You will be able to find this by going to your network settings, properties and under *\"IPv4 address\"*.\n- Now its time to pair. Head to the *\"Pin\"* section on your host PC. \n- Click *\"Pair\"* in the Moonlight port. This will now show a pin. Fill this pin into Sunshine. Also fill in the device name, this can be named after your device such a *\"RG35XX\"*. \n- After sending the signal on you host PC, you will receive a message *\"Succesfully paired\"* in the moonlight app on your handheld. \n- Head over to the *\"Reload Apps\"* function on your handheld. Click on it and you will see the currently configured apps from Sunshine. Every time you update the Apps in Sunshine, use this function.\n- Head to the *\"Play Menu\"* and select the app you want to stream, Steam for example. \n- The Moonlight app will close on your handheld and it will start streaming. Wait 5 seconds for the controls.\n- Have fun!\n\n## Recommendations: ##\n- Moonlight requires a very good internet connection to get a decent experience. There are many factors at play such a the detail of the game your running. Simpler 2d games are easier to stream and require less power to decode on your handheld. You will have to try and find a balance of bitrate and framerate for your setup. \n- Experiencing input and/or audio delay? Lower the bitrate, resolution, or framerate. Reconnecting may help random desyncing issues.\n- Moonlight will maintain aspect ratio of your host PC monitor. You can get a better picture by manually changing the resolution to your devices native resolution, such as 640x480. There are ways to automate this process, such as  [ResolutionAutomation](https://github.com/Nonary/ResolutionAutomation). Use these programs on your own risk.\n- Inputs may be reversed. Mouse mode does not work on Moonlight-Embedded. Both can be resolved by using SteamInput.\n- Its recommended to check your connection before streaming, use the pair function for this. Does it say *\"Already paired\"*, then youre good to go. It may also say something like *\"App already opened\"*, you need to use *\"Force Close\"* under the troubleshooting options in Sunshine.\n- Most important of all, dont expect an amazing experience going in. These handhelds are not ideal for Streaming, even though they may seem like it.\n",
