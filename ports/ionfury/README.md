## Notes

Thanks to the devs at https://www.eduke32.com for the source port for build engine titles.

Source: [eduke32-rg351p](https://github.com/krishenriksen/eduke32-rg351p)  (this was the initial eduke32 modification, but isn't up-to-date)

It is recommended to use an RK3566 or faster CPU to run Ion Fury, but is still somewhat playable on rk3326.

To invert right joystick look, set mouse-look invert option in the game's options menu:
Options > Control Setup > Controller Setup > Edit Axes > Right Stick Y-Axis > Invert: Off

-Install GOG Galaxy.
-Use GOG Galaxy to install Ion Fury and untick the box to (not) keep it automatically up to date.
-Once Ion Fury is installed, click the 'more' button at the top of GOG Galaxy -> Manage Installation -> Configure..
-Click on the show more versions link and you can "Roll back".

Game data files needed from Ion Fury version 1.10 or earlier:

- ionfury/fury.def
- ionfury/fury.grp
- ionfury/fury.grpinfo

While an earlier release can be obtained via Steam via:
1) Enter steam://nav/console in the URL of your web browser
2) From the Steam Console, type   download_depot 562860 562861 189007903929408028

Only the GOG release has been thoroughly tested working.  With the Steam release, YMMV.
