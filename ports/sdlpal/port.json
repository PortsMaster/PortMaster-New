The game is considered by many as simply one of the best Chinese RPG ever created. Since its first release in 1995 (DOS Version), many new versions and sequels (including a prequel) were created. However, none could replace the breath-taking and tragic tale it was born from. Here, we meet our protagonist Li Xiaoyao; an aspiring martial artist and the lovely Zhao Ling'er, a charismatic Nuwa descendant.​",
