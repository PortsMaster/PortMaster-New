    "desc_md": "The Legend of Sword and Fairy (Chinese: 仙劍奇俠傳; pinyin: Xiānjiàn Qíxiá Zhuàn), also known as Sword and Fairy (仙劍) or Chinese Paladin, is a Chinese language fantasy video game series and media franchise centered on a series of nine Chinese mythology/xianxia-themed adventure role-playing computer games created by Yao Zhuangxian. The eponymous first game in the series is released for MS-DOS CLI in 1995 by the 'Crazy Boyz' team (狂徒創作群) of the Taiwanese game developing and publishing company Softstar Entertainment (大宇資訊). It is one of the so-called 'Twin Swords of Softstar' (大宇雙劍) along with the sister Xuan-Yuan Sword series, and has been widely regarded as one of the (if not the) most iconic Chinese RPG series ever made.​",
