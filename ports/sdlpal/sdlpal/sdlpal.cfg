# KeepAspectRatio: Indicates whether the content in game window should keep its original
#                  aspect ratio (default) or not. When aspect ratio is kept, there may be
#                  left/right or top/bottom black edges in the game window. Currently this
#                  value is only valid if the game is built with SDL 2.0 or higher, otherwise
#                  this value is ignored.

# UseSurroundOPL: Indicates whether to use surround opl emulator or not. Non-zero
#                 means to using (default), while zero means not to use. Only

# EnableHDR: ACESFilm based HDR effect. Only valid when EnableGLSL=1.
EnableHDR=0

# TextureWidth/TextureHeight:
#   1. When EnableGLSL=1, the final(before blitting) texture size. If your mobile device have very
#      high resolution and the GPU cannot afford the Shader specified, try set a lower texture size.
#   2. When EnableGLSL=0, only specify the ratio that KeepAspectRatio use.
TextureHeight=400
TextureWidth=640

# ScaleQuality: Indicates whether use bilinear filtering when stretching, only avilable when EnableGLSL=0
#               In other case the shader handles it.
ScaleQuality=0

# SurroundOPLOffset: Indicates the frequency offset of surround opl. The default and
#                    recommended value is 384, but other values may also be used.

# LogLevel: This value controls how many logs can be output by the program. Valid ranges are:
# 0 (Verbose), 1 (Debug), 2 (Informational), 3 (Warning), 4 (Error) and 5 (Fatal). Only logs
# whose levels are larger or equal to this value can be output.
LogLevel=0

# AudioDevice: The ID of audio device to use. Only supported when compiled with SDL2. If this
#              item is set to a negative value (default), the default audio device will be used.
AudioDevice=-1

# AudioBufferSize: Indicates the size of audio buffer in samples. Valid values are in

# ResampleQuality: Indicates the resample quality, valid values from 0 to 4 (default).
#                  Larger value indicates higher quality and higher hardware requirement.
ResampleQuality=4

# SampleRate: Indicates which sample rate to use, valid values include 44100 (default),

#             on iOS/Win32/UWP/ANGLE no setting needed, so forget this setting.
#             on *nix that have alsa devel library compiled, specify ALSA MIDI Port here.
#             otherwise, specify any midiplayer or wrapper here, that accept
#             `CLI midifile` syntax.
#MIDIClient=14.0

# OPLCore: Indicates the OPL emulator core to use. Valid types include 'DBFLT'
#          (default), 'MAME', 'DBINT' and 'NUKED'.
