    "desc": "A long, long time ago, when people lived among gods and monsters, seven kingdoms struggled for rule over the land. Lead one of those civilizations to glory through sophisticated trade, diplomacy, espionage and conquest. Choose from one of seven cultures: Greek, Persian, Viking, Norman, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese and compete for domination. Each Race in Seven Kingdoms has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages, its own unique God unit, a different military skill, its own strengths and weaknesses. Learn how to use them! Use military means, economy or subterfuge to bring down your enemies. And don't forget about brute force, cunning and intelligence.",
