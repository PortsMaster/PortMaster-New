    <desc>Aberration: A temporary change from the typical or usual way of behaving. To reach your goal, you must change yourself.

This game can be difficult, but the difficulty curve dips down every time a new mechanic is introduced. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to skip ahead - there is no penalty for doing so!</desc>
