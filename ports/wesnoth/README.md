### Acknowledgements
Thanks to David White and many other contributors for creating the game. See [here](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Credits) for credits.

Thanks to kloptops for his [SDL_sim_cursor](https://github.com/kloptops/SDL_sim_cursor) library.

Thanks to Slayer366, Fraxinus99, Ganimoth and ddrsoul for their help with the port.

### Building

The source code has been modified to add kloptops's sim_cursor library, which enables the mouse cursor on platforms that don't support a hardware cursor.

On Rocknix, commands are sent to sway before and after the game is run, to disable and re-enable hiding of the mouse cursor (which causes problems with click detection on touchscreen devices).

Various animations are disabled in order to save memory, and fit the game into 1GB.

See [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-New/blob/main/ports/wesnoth/wesnoth/BUILDING.md) for building instructions.
