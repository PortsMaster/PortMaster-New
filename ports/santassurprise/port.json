    "desc": "'Twas the morning of Christmas Eve. The whole North Pole was preparing for the big night of present delivering and joy giving. Only Santa was nowhere to be seen... He was out in the forest on a very important mission - to get a present for Mrs. Claus. She had always wanted a cute little puppy, but there was only one problem - the workshop didn't make any puppies! So this year Santa ventured deep into the woods to meet with a local sled owner and adopt one of his adorable little huskies. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it to make the one he loves happy.",
