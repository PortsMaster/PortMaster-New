## Isles of Sea and Sky -- PortMaster Edition
Isles of Sea and Sky is a sokoban block puzzle game with Zelda-like elements and a stunning soundtrack. With a lot of effort, this game is able to be run on small-arm linux handhelds using a Game Maker compatibility layer called GMLoader-Next and some patches to reduce memory and cpu usage.

## Installation
Add your game data from your Steam or Itch.io installation (v1.02a) to `ports/iosas/assets`. First-time run will handle sorting data.

## Default Gameplay Controls
| Button | Action |

|SELECT|Map|
|D-PAD / Analog|Move|
|L1|Undo|
|R1|Reset room|

## Config
The xdelta patch enables `gamedata/pm-config.ini`, which has some performance options. Testing found that `FrameSkip=40` works pretty well for the H700 chip. For no stuttering at all, you can set `IdolSFX=0` to turn off the special effect that bogs down the cpu.

## Importing / Exporting Save Data
Steam saves are located at `\AppData\Local\IslesOfSeaAndSky` on Windows. Copy `save_v1_000.dat` or similar to `ports/iosas/saves` to use it. To export save data to your Steam or Itch.io install, do the reverse.
