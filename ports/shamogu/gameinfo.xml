    <desc>Shamanic Mountain Guardian (Shamogu) is a coffee-break roguelike game with a focus on tactical movement and careful timing of totemic spirit invocation and comestible consumption. Visibility and noise stealth mechanics also play an important role.

      “All life in your mountain is being corrupted. Beasts are losing their mind and becoming aggressive. These disturbing events started to happen after a dungeon portal suddenly appeared at the top of the mountain. As the guardian, you decide to explore that dungeon in order to find and destroy the source of corruption… You hope luck will be on your side!”</desc>
