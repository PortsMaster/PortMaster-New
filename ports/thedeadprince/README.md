Analog Sticks are required for this game.
Thank You so much to StudioLintex for permission to include the Demo Game in this R2R port! He was so great to work with! Check out the game on Steam here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1810530/The_Dead_Prince/
Also, I want to thank @Doronimmo and @tabreturn both, from the discord, SO MUCH for their help in getting this port finished. I couldn't have done it without them!
