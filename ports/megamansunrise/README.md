## Notes

MEGA THANK YOU to DJ Coco https://x.com/CliaxGamesCoco, for creating this wonderful fan made take of a classic that we all know and love, and for allowing me to port it to PortMaster as a ready to run title! Thank you!
Another thank you to Slayer366 for advice on earlier build!ðŸŽ© Thank you, tabreturn, for fixing controls in the game! You are a huge help! Thanks also to, all who tested this port and to each of you, who help make gmloader possible. Big thank you to you, the user! Without you helping to build the PortMaster community, there would not be one. You make this hobby into something extra wonderful for me!ðŸŽ© Thank you all!
You can also download & play this game on itch.io as it is currently hosted there by Titus Beardog https://titus-beardog1996.itch.io/mega-man-sunrise. Had it not been for Titus Beardog1996, sharing this, I'd possibly have no clue of it's existence. Thank you, Titus Beardog1996!
