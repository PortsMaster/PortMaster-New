## Notes

Thanks to [Jon Topielski](https://jontopielski.itch.io) for creating this great game and permitting PortMaster to distribute the files.

**Note for ArkOS users:** When the battery warning is enabled and plays when the game starts, it can interfere with the Godot runtime's audio detection.
