# doukutsu-rs: A fully playable re-implementation of the Cave Story (Doukutsu Monogatari) engine written in Rust.

This port is a build of doukutsu-rs, see:
 [https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs](https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs)

You can play either the original freeware game, or the Cave Story+, with enhanced graphics, sound and other features.

Thanks to Studio Pixel/Nicalis for the wonderful original game and Cave Story+. Thanks to the doukutsu-rs team for the amazing reimplementation.


## Installation

Copy the game files into your `ports/doukutsu-rs` folder. You can use the original freeware Cave Story files, which can be found here: [https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php](https://www.cavestory.org/download/cave-story.php)

Or, you can buy Cave Story+ on Steam. This has higher-resolution graphics, remastered music and other enhancements.

The game uses the SDL controller by default, but controls can be reconfigured in the game.
