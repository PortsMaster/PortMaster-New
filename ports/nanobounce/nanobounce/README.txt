This game is a known cause of tension headaches.  Enjoy!

Gameplay
================================================================================

The goal of the game is simple: bounce the ball to the exit.

The exit is marked with green circles; exiting anywhere else will result in doom
for the ball.

The ball can jump off walls if it is pushed in the opposite direction as it hits
the wall.

The rest is simple enough. :)
