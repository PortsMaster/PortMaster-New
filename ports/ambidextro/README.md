| Mode                        | Main Features                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ambidextro Virtual Control**            | Virtual control, high compatibility across all CFWs.         |
| **Ambidextro Native  Control**     | Native control, higher precision, may need manual remapping, limited support on some CFWs. |
| **Ambidextro lightweight**| No effects, optimized for consoles with restricted hardware.  |

> **Note:** The *lightweight* version defaults to using native control. If virtual control is used, performance may be **reduced**, especially on consoles with limited resources. For best results, it is recommended to use a CFW that supports native control.

## Important Notes

- On low-resource clone consoles, you may experience FPS drops during the first levels while the game finishes caching all its data. After this, gameplay should proceed normally.


## Ambidextro

**Ambidextro** is the perfect game to enjoy on any handheld console: straightforward, challenging, and very fun.

Created by **Alva Majo**, this game is a *multiplayer for a single player*. Learn to control two characters at the same time, one with each hand. Develop your ambidexterity and rescue both the prince and the princess simultaneously.
