## Notes

Thanks to [VCMI Team](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi) for the open source Heroes of Might and Magic III engine that makes this possible.  Also thanks to the @kloptops for the porting work for portmaster.  
Update to 1.6.5 was made by @ddrsoul with great help of @kloptops , @kotzebuedog and all VCMI and PortMaster community.

## Detailed Instructions

You need to add required game files either from CD1 & CD2, GoG or an installed copy of the game.  
This requires about 2-3 gb of free space. For the gog version copy setup_heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_4.0_(28740)-1.bin and setup_heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_4.0_(28740).exe into ports/vcmi.  
For the cd version copy the contents of cd1 into ports/vcmi/cd1 and cd2 into ports/vcmi/cd2.  
For the installed version copy installed game files into ports/vcmi/install.

## Controls

VCMI supports gamepad controls.
Controller mapping can be redone in ./config/shortcutsConfig.json  

Some additional settings can be made in ./save/settings.json:  
"input" : {  
    "enableController" : true // turn controller detection on/off  
    "controllerTriggerTreshold" : 0.3  // triggers, e.g. L2/R2 on PS controller would activate if they are pressed to 30%  
    "controllerAxisDeadZone" : 0.2 // analog sticks would activate if they are at 20% from resting position  
    "controllerAxisFullZone" : 1.0 // analog sticks would be maxed-out when they are at 100% from resting position  
    "controllerAxisSpeed" : 1000 // analog sticks would move at 1000 px/second  
    "controllerAxisScale" : 2 // adds acceleration to analog sticks. So, half-pressed stick would actually move not at 500 px/second, but 250 px/s IIRC. Changing to 1 would make analog sticks linear  
	}  

## Building

```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi.git
```
 
replace ./server/processors/PlayerMessageProcessor.cpp:686 ```boost::split(words, boost::trim_copy(cheat), boost::is_any_of("\t\r\n "));```  with 
 
```
	std::string cheatTrimmed = boost::trim_copy(cheat);
	boost::split(words, cheatTrimmed, boost::is_any_of("\t\r\n "));
```
replace ./client/windows/GUIClasses.cpp:1404 ```boost::split(lines, CGI->generaltexth->allTexts[184], boost::is_any_of("\n"));``` with

```
	std::string textCGItemp = CGI->generaltexth->allTexts[184];
	boost::split(lines, textCGItemp, boost::is_any_of("n"));
```
	put DATA_PATHS.diff inside ./vcmi folder
 
```
    git apply DATA_PATHS.diff

    mkdir build
    cd build
