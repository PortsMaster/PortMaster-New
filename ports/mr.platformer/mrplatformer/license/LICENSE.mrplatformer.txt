Well, I gave that a try, and looks like everything works fine (though I didn't do a complete replay) - here you go!

Oh, cool! Yeah, this sounds great. Do you need the source code? (If not, there's a downloadable build on the itch page already: https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/mr-platformer)

Hi, Terry

I'm Tristan, a member of the PortMaster team (http://portmaster.games/). We port games to handheld Linux devices. We've even ported the fantastic VVVVV.

We've started adding various Godot games to these systems and would love to include Mr Platformer. Would it be possible to provide a build of the game for the Godot 4.1.x runtime?

Our users could download this (4.1 build) from your website/Itch.io and manually add it to the port files we provide. Alternatively, it would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include the .pck in our packages, then users would not have to download and manually add that.

Please note we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.

Thank you for considering our request!

Best regards,
Tristan
