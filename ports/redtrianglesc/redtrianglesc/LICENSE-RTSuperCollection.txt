Hey Tristan,

I'm down for the inclusion. Thank you for that. I am working on an update for the collection in the next couple of weeks if you can wait that long.

Thanks!
Matt

Hi --

Thanks for the response on itch (https://itch.io/post/11239675)

My name is Tristan. I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster http://portmaster.games

We've added various OHRRPGCE games to these systems and would love to include the Red Triangle Super Collection as a ready-to-run game. Would you permit us to include your .rpg file in our packages? Without your consent, users must manually download the files for our ports.

You wouldn't have to do anything -- we have all the wrappers, etc. and can adapt the game.

Importantly, we do not want to profit or take credit for your games; our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices.

Thank you for considering our request!

Cheers
Tristan
