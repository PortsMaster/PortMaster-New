## Notes

Thanks to HMCL ( Hello Minecraft Client ) to help with making the scripts

Thanks to BinaryCounter for its Westonpack, which makes all of this possible

Thanks to the PortMaster Community who tested and made some improvements themself

Thanks to MrTschnitzel for making the Forge 1.7.10 Performance mode

## Performance
If you want the best Performance then i would recommend Vanilla 1.7.10 but regardless 1.16.5 can also run pretty good on lower end devices when you add mods, the only version that tends to be bad on lower end devices is vanilla 1.13
## Bugs and Unsupported Mods
On 1.16.5 you dont have a mouse cursor

Unsupported Mods for 1.16.5:
- Distant Horizons
- Sodium can work but crashes sometimes
- Hydrogen
