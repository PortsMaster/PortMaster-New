You start in a big, blocky world with nothing, and little by little, you gather, build, explore, and create your own adventures. Whether you're surviving the night or just chilling in Creative mode building dream houses, it\u2019s a game about freedom, creativity, and having fun your own way.\n\nNot all versions are Supported, currently only 1.7.10 (with Forge), 1.12 (with Forge) and 1.16.5 (Fabric only) are supported",

Follow these steps carefully:\n✅ Step 1: Prepare Minecraft on Your PC\n\n    Install Minecraft on your PC via the official launcher.\n\n    Launch the version you want to play at least once to make sure all files are generated.\n\n    (Optional but important!)\n    If you want to use a mod loader like Forge or Fabric, install it and launch that version once as well.\n\n📂 Step 2: Find the Game Files\n\nOn your PC, Minecraft stores game files in this folder:\n\nC:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Roaming\\.minecraft\\versions\n\nTo access that folder Press the Windows Key on your Keyboard and R\n    Win + R\nYou should see a new Window called Run, in there write %appdata% and press Enter\n\nNow you should see a .minecraft directory\n\n📁 Step 3: Copy to Your PortMaster Device\n\n    Connect your device to your PC or insert the SD card.\n\n    On your device, go to:\n\n    /ports/minecraftjava\n\n    Now copy the earlier found .minecraft Directory from Step 2 into the /ports/minecraftjava folder\n    If it asks to overwrite files press NO !!!
