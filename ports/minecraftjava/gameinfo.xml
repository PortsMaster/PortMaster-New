    <desc>Minecraft is a game where you can do pretty much whatever you want. Want to build a giant castle? Go for it. Feel like exploring caves and fighting skeletons? Totally an option. You start in a big, blocky world with nothing, and little by little, you gather, build, explore, and create your own adventures. Whether you're surviving the night or just chilling in Creative mode building dream houses, itâ€™s a game about freedom, creativity, and having fun your own way.</desc>
