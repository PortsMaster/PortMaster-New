Hello, this'd be great thank you! Since it's a pay-what-you-want game, if there's a way to link back to the original itch page that'd be nice, but go for it!

Hi Samanthauel

Formless Star is great! Well done.

Would it be cool if we added this to PortMaster, too? Again, I'd be asking for permission to include the .rpg file in our port package.

Thanks
Tristan

Hi, Samanthauel

My name is Tristan. I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster http://portmaster.games

We've added various OHRRPGCE games to these systems and would love to include Franken. Would you permit us to include your franken.rpg file in our packages? Without your consent, users must manually download the .rpg files for our ports.

We do not want to profit or take credit for your games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices.

Thank you for considering our request!

Cheers
T
