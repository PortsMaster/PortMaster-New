Sam travels through the beautiful world of ancient Egypt and several diverse planets, confronting countless Mental's minions on his way to the Mental's base. This source port of Serious Sam was originally modded to work on the Dragonbox Pyra handheld. GL video accelerated with GL4ES by ptitseb (same dev who also does box86 and box64)!",
