<title>Depots</title>

<h1><strong>Depot Controls</strong></h1>

<p>
Depots are used to purchase and manage vehicles. Different types of transport have their own depot. Depots only show electric vehicle-units if on electric tracks.<br>
If playing with <a href="new_world.txt">timeline</a>, then as time passes in Simutrans more vehicle-units may appear.
</p>
<p>
Tools for the construction of different depots are available from the construction toolbar for the type of transport: <a href="railtools.txt">Train Depot</a>; <a href="monorailtools.txt">Monorail Depot</a>; <a href="tramtools.txt">Tram Depot</a>; <a href="roadtools.txt">Road Depot</a>; <a href="shiptools.txt">Ship Depot</a> and <a href="airtools.txt">Aircraft Hangar</a>.

Colours indicate:<br>
- <em>green:</em> vehicle-unit can be used.<br>

</p>
<p>
<em>Show obsolete:</em> if playing with <a href="new_world.txt">timeline</a>, square-button when indented (click to use) displays vehicle-units that have been retired.
