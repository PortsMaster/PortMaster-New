<title>List of all vehicle</title>

<h1>List of all in the game Vehicle types </h1>
<p>By default, all vehicles currently coming current and future will be shown. Show the future is also the real sense of this list. In the depots, the upcoming vehicles are not visible. The player can better plan for the future.
</p>
<p>
<em>Show future</em> by deselection, the list can be limited to the currently purchasable vehicles. <br>
<em>Show obsolete</em> expands the list with the already outdated vehicles. This feature is the same in the depots. <br>
Behind it at <em>All</em> can be restricted to the type of goods as well as passengers or post.
