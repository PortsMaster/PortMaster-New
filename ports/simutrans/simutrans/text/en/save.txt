<h1><strong>Save</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Save</strong> stores the current game to a file (to continue play at a later time) & can be used to delete these files.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Save</strong> opens from <a href="options.txt">Game Options</a> or by pressing <a href="keys.txt">[S]</a>; & list names, date & time of previous games.<br>
If all games are not visible: use <a href="mouse.txt">slider-bar</a> on right-side of list to scroll names.
</p>
<p>
The current game can be saved to a new file or over an existing game.<br>
To save game to new file, enter new name into box at top of
 <strong>Save</strong>: click on box, type name & press [Enter] or [Return] or click on <em>OK</em>; the new filename is listed.<br>
IMPORTANT: If a listed filename is used: old game is replaced, by current game, & lost.
</p>
<p>
By default the current game appears in filename box, to save to this file: click <em>OK</em> (old data is lost and replaced with current data).<br>
To save game to file over an old game: click on a name in list (old game is replaced by current game).
</p>
