<h1><strong>Industry Information</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Industry Information</strong> shows details about a selected Industry (a supplier or consumer of goods) and allows game-view to be moved to related positions in game-world.
</p>
<p>
Suppliers and consumers of goods link to provide an Industry Supply Chain which terminates in an end-consumer. Some Industry is both a consumer and supplier and lies in the middle of an Industry Supply Chain. If not playing in <a href="new_world.txt">beginners mode</a>, Industry will cease supply if consumer has excess supply.<br>
Industries may also be a destination for and origin of passengers and mail. Vehicles collect and deliver goods and passengers to an Industry through <a href="station.txt">Stops</a> if the catchment area of the Stop covers any portion of the Industry building and if the Stop can handle the item.

The intial number of Industry Supply Chains can be set in <a href="new_world.txt">Create New World</a>.
As <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a> grow more industry may appear. New industry appears each time the population of an urban area doubles from about 2000 onwards.<br>
{Tips: Add Industry to an urban area using <a href="edittools.txt">Build a new market in the nearest city</a> tool in ?Game Edit Tools. Change when new industries are generated in cityrules.tab (industry_increase_every = 0 generates no new industry)}.
