Every tile on the game-world has two coordinates (x,y), with (0,0) located on the top-left corner of the map. Cursor coordinates are permanently displayed on the <a href="window.txt">status bar</a>.<br>
NOTE: A map rotation (performed with <a href="keys.txt">[R]</a> key) will rotate all tile coordinates.
