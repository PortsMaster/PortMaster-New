<title>Load Height Map</title>

<h1><strong>Load Height Map</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Load Height Map</strong> window is used to open a file of a custom-made terrain (for use when creating a new game) & can also be used to delete these files. It opens from <a href="new_world.txt">Create a New Game</a> window and it lists the names, dates & times (of save) of available custom-terrain files. If not all filenames are visible, use the <a href="mouse.txt">slider-bar</a> on the right-side of list to scroll through the names.
</p>
<p>
Click the name in the list to load a custom-terrain map, or enter a name into the text box at the top of the window: click on box, type name & press <a href="keys.txt">[Enter]</a> or [Return], or click on <em>OK</em> (an incorrect name will have no effect, try again).
</p>
<p>
WARNING: Click <em>x</em>-button (if enabled in simuconf.tab) on the left of the name to DELETE the file immediately & permanently; the filename is removed from list and <strong>Load Height Map</strong> window closes. Use this function carefully!
</p>
<p>
Some custom-made terrains are available online at http://maps.simutrans.com. The new file must be in .ppm or .bmp format (best 256 colors RLE compressed) and placed in the personal directory (or folder) named simutrans/maps/
</p>

TIP: Information on how to create custom terrains is available online at http://wiki.simutrans.com
