<p>The map has different zoom levels: use mouse-wheel, page up/down or the buttons to change them. You can also tilt the map to match the display using the <em>isometric map</em> button.
</p>
<p>On the map, water is blue and lower land is darker than higher land. The currently visible part of the world on the screen is indicated by a yellow-square outline. To move this field of vision across the world, left-click on map at desired location or left-click-drag the yellow-square.

<p>On the default map (when not using the options) <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a> and attraction are grey, powerlines turquoise, tunnels are brown, elevated ways light brown, and bridges light grey. On the ground ways have their distinct colors: Roads appear nearly black; rail and tram tracks are dark brown; canals are blue; and runways are dark yellow. All other ways (like narrow gauge, maglev, or monorail tracks) are light red. <a href="station.txt">Stops</a> are red. Vehicles on ways are yellow.
</p>
<p>The button <em>Networks</em> will overlay an abstract line network like a subway map over the map. Using the yellow button, you can restrict it to only show passenger, Mail or freight connections.
</p>
<p>Using the selection button many additional informations can be overlaid. Those fall in three groups. White and yellow buttons are exclusive and will disable any other white option. Green buttons are for overlays that can be combined with any other. The third group are the red buttons for stops. From this stop group only one can be active at a time.
