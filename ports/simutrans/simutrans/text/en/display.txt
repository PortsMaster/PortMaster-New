<h1><strong>Display Settings</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Display Settings</strong> window has controls for how the game appears and provides information on computer performance.
</p>

<p>
Click on <em>Display</em> button in <a href="options.txt">Game Options</a> menu to open <strong>Display Settings</strong> window.
</p>

<p>
Click on square buttons to select options (buttons are indented when the relevant option is selected), or use the <a href="mouse.txt">arrow-buttons</a> to adjust settings:
</p>

<p>
<em>Show grid:</em> shows the lines between individual tiles; can be useful when terraforming.
</p>

<p>
<em>Underground view:</em> reveals beneath the ground; here you can build transport networks using tunnels; all levels of underground are displayed together.
</p>

<p>
<em>Sliced map view:</em> in this mode you can also build underground; the map is cut at the specified level and only tunnels on the respective level are displayed; the level can be adjusted with the arrows, or entered directly as a number in the box.
</p>

<p>
<em>Day and Night cycle:</em> if selected, game will cycle between day and night.
</p>

<p>
<em>Brightness:</em> sets how light/dark view of game appears; higher values are darker; too low or high values produce problems.
</p>

<p>
<em>Scroll Inverse:</em> reverses the direction of scroll for game-view in <a href="window.txt">Game Window</a>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Scroll Speed:</em> sets the scroll-speed for game-view.
</p>

<p>
<em>Transparent instead of hidden:</em> objects that are selected as hidden (trees or certain buildings) will instead appear semi-transparent.
</p>

<p>
<em>Hide trees:</em> all trees are hidden.
</p>

<p>
<em>Buildings display mode:</em> you can select with the help of arrows whether 'no buildings', 'only city buildings' or 'all buildings' are hidden.
</p>

<p>
<em>Smart hide objects:</em> depending on the setting, objects across a certain number of tiles around the mouse pointer are hidden; the number of tiles can be set with the arrows or directly by entering a number in the box.
</p>

<p>
<em>Transparent station coverage:</em> shows the catchment area of stops/stations as transparent, rather than as a grid; colored in player's own color.
</p>

<p>
<em>Show station coverage:</em> displays the catchment area for each stop/station.
</p>

<p>
<em>Show station names:</em> toggles the style in which the name of each stop/station is displayed.
</p>

<p>
<em>Show waiting bars:</em> toggles whether the miniature bar graphs showing the proportion of waiting goods/passengers as against the station's total capacity is displayed or not.
</p>

<p>
<em>Pedestrians in towns:</em> toggles the display of pedestrians moving across <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Pedestrians at stops:</em> toggles the display of pedestrians getting off a vehicle at <a href="station.txt">stops</a>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Traffic density:</em> determines the amount of private cars in <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a>.<br><br>
The number of new private cars generated in urban areas is dependent on size of urban area and on traffic density setting; higher values create more private traffic, while '0' generates none.
</p>

<p>
<em>Convoy tooltips:</em> customizes the amount of information displayed about convoys in game-view.
</p>

<p>
<em>Show schedule's stops:</em> if activated, all stops and waypoints are displayed when a vehicle's schedule is open.
</p>

<p>
TIP: More options and default values for when Simutrans starts can be changed in simuconf.tab file, located in simutrans/config/ folder.
</p>

<p>
<it>Display performance information</it>
</p>

<p>
Below these settings, information is shown on computer performance when running Simutrans. Numbers are white when everything is working well; if they are red or yellow then you may need to change your settings.<br><br>
If you change how fast time passes in the game, by using Fast Forward icon <em>>></em> at the top of game-view, or <a href="keys.txt">[,]</a> / <a href="keys.txt">[.]</a> keys, this may also change the number colour.
</p>

<p>
<em>Frame Time:</em> Shows the actual time between frames.
</p>

<p>
<em>Idle:</em> Shows how long the computer pauses between two screen updates. When above 0, the computer has capacity to run other tasks along Simutrans.
</p>

<p>
<em>FPS:</em> Higher values mean vehicles appear to move more smoothly. In Fast Forward and Network mode the frame rate is fixed, otherwise it varies according to the workload. A default value can be set with the command line parameter '-fps' or in simuconf.tab file. If this number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings (try reducing the size of the game-view window).
</p>

<p>
<em>Simloops:</em> Number of simulation loops per second. If number remains red, the computer is too slow for current settings (try a smaller map with fewer urban areas).
</p>
