<title>Sound Settings</title>

<h1><strong>Sound Settings</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Sound Settings</strong> window has controls for sound effects & background music. It opens from <a href="options.txt">Game Options</a> menu.<br>
NOTE: To get better sounds in Windows an SDL-compiled version of Simutrans is recommended.
</p>

<p>
Use arrow-buttons to adjust settings or <a href="mouse.txt">slider-bars</a> to decrease/increase volume.
</p>

<p><em>Sound volume:</em> sets volume of sound effects in game. Sounds can be switched off completely with the <em>Mute sound</em> button.<br><br>
Many Simutrans objects are able to produce sounds: ambiental (at cursor position after several seconds of no movement), way crossings (when approached by vehicles), factories (when producing goods), vehicles (when departing stop/stations). It depends on the pakset you play what sounds are implemented.
</p>

<p>
<em>Music volume:</em> sets volume of background music. Music can be switched off completely with the <em>Mute MIDI music</em> button. If no music is available then controls will not function.<br>
Music tracks (in MIDI format) are stored in folder simutrans/music/.
</p>

<p>
<em>Currently playing:</em> changes music; arrow-buttons cycle through available music tracks.
</p>

<p>
<em>Shuffle tracks:</em> music tracks are played at random.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: If Simutrans is started with command-line option '-nosound' or '-nomidi', sound or music will not be used.
