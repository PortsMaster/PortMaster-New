<h1><strong>Schedule Controls</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Schedule Controls</strong> sets the Schedule (route and minimum quantity of goods and passengers required by a <a href="convoiinfo.txt">Convoy</a> to proceed) for a Convoy or a <a href="linemanagement.txt">Line</a>.<br>
It lists<a href="station.txt">Stops</a> (where Convoys pick-up and drop-off goods and passengers) and waypoints (which can be used to direct Convoys to a path if more than one is available or provide interim destination points) with their map co-ordinates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Schedule Controls</strong> for a Convoy opens from Schedule option-button in <a href="convoiinfo.txt">Convoy Information</a> and <a href="depot.txt">Depot Controls</a>.<br>
Controls for the Schedule of a Line open from New Line and Update Line option-buttons in <a href="linemanagement.txt">Line Management</a> and <a href="depot.txt">Depot Controls</a>.
