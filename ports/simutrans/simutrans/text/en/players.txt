Players can be protected by passwords. If you play as a protected player you have access to many statistics but are not allowed to change anything game relevant for this player.<br/>
A protected player is marked by a red box to the right of his name. If no password is set or the player is unlocked, this box is shown in green. Click on the box to open the password dialog, where the passwort can be typed or set.

For network games cooperation between players may be desirable. You can make you stops public. Any player can either connect or directly drive to a public stop. Also tracks can be shared, by making the connection tiles public. Control over which companies are allowed to run on such  a track can be done via <a href="privatesign_info.txt">gates</a>.

<p>
Players may not build items or place waypoints on another player's track or <a href="roadtools.txt">road</a>, or remove items built by another player (however some items built by the public service player may be removed using <a href="removal_tool.txt">Destroy/Remove</a>).

<p>
At the bottom is an option to enable freeplay mode (if the public player is not locked). In this mode you will never get bankrupt. Otherwise after getting a negative company values, a player will be eliminated and the slot freed after a year.
