<em>Replace a stop:</em> This tool can be used to replace a stop in the schedules of all of the convoys and lines that use it. It can also be used to change the scheduled tile within a stop (for example, to move all the lines to a different platform of a railway station). After selecting the tool, click on the stop (or part of a stop) that you wish to remove from the schedules and then on the stop (or part of a stop) that you wish to use in future. All the convoys that previously used the first stop will now use the second stop.
