<strong>Schedule</strong> is the leftmost tab. Here the <a href="schedule.txt">Schedule</a> for all <a href="convoiinfo.txt">Convoy</a> in this line can be altered. Their schedule will be replaced with the new as soon as the tab is changed or the <em>Line Information</em> is closed. The tab will be seletced automatically, if the <em>Line Information</em> was opened from the <em>Depot</em> or the <em>Convoy Information</em>.</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Vehicle List</strong> 
shows all <a href="convoiinfo.txt">Convoys</a> assigned to this Line. If a Convoy is missing, this Convoy was probbably assinged a new schedule manually and thus was removed from the Line.</p>
<p>
There are three management buttons:<br/>
- <em>Delete Line</em> deletes this Line, and closes this window. All connected Convoys will continue with the current schedule.<br/>
- <em>Withdraw All</em> retires all Convoys in the Line outside a Depot. The Convoys will not longer take any new load and will be sold whenever they become empty. This can be used to update the Convoys of this Line: Open a <a href="depot.txt">Depot</a> that serves this Line, assemble a new Convoy, and assign it to this Line. Then select <em>Withdraw All</em>, copy the new Convoy in the Depot as often as needed, and start all new Convoys.</p>
