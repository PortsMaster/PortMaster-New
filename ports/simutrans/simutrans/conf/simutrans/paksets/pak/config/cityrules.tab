# now the actual building rules. They can be up to 7x7.
# allowed sizes are 3x3 5x5 and 7x7!
#

#
# Symbols in rules:
# S = must not be road
# s = must be road
# n = must be bare land
# H = must not be house
# h = must be house
# T = not a stop	// added in 88.03.3

# t = is a stop // added in 88.03.
# U = allowed slope for roads

# u = forbidden slope for roads

# . = anything matches
# SPACE = next row
#
# Each row must have EXACTLY the same number of members!
