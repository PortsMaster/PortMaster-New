That means that it consumes up to {g1_consum} {g1_metric} of {good1} per month and produces {g2_prod} {g2_metric} of {good2} out of it.<br/><em>Consumers/Suppliers:</em><br/>Shows the connected factories <st>(You can only transport goods to connected factories)</st>.<br/><em>Workers live in:</em><br/>Shows where the workers live and how many workers live in that town.<br/><em>Note:</em> transporting workers to the factory is not mandatory for the factory to produce although it can increase production rate.</p><p><st>To take to the next step, click on</st> {f1}.</p>
