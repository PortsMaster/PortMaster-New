## Notes

Thanks to [Bippinbits](https://bippinbits.com) for creating this great game and which you can purchase in [itch.io](https://bippinbits.itch.io/of-mice-and-moggies)

Requires the Windows version: `Of Mice and Moggies.zip` -- *Sep 14, 2021*

**Note:** 

- The UI/buttons are tiny on small-to-medium screens, but it should be easy enough to navigate and play despite this (it requires minimal navigation to get playing, and this won't affect gameplay)
- Community Level downloads are functional
- The (level) Editor requires a mouse (and there's no cursor either) -- instead, you can create levels on your PC and copy them over
