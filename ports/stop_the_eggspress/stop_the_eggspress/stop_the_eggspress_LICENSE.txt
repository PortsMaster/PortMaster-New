Hi Tim,

Yes, that's absolutely fine.  I'm afraid I've never heard of the RGB30 or any of the other projects you mention, but the more options for gaming the better. (And if it's my games, so much the better! ðŸ˜„)

Cheers,

Stephen

    Hi Stephen,

    I am a hobbyist game developer and came across some of your fab  games on itch.io. I am in the process of creating some Godot games myself.

    I also got an RGB30 (a small hand held linux device for Christmas) and found a project called portmaster that lets godot games run on the aarch64 device :)

    I was hoping that it might be possible to include your pck files on that project so that people could try them out.

    Please see post below as  a request to include the game pck file on portmaster.

    I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. 
    Our project is named PortMaster, and we also have an active Discord server. Recently, we've started adding various Godot games to these systems, and I'd love to include your games as well. 
    Although these devices have some limitations with OpenGL, games that use GLES3 and SDL generally run very smoothly. I've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. 

    However, I firmly believe in reaching out to authors like you to ask for consent. It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include the .pck in the packages. Without your consent, users would 
    have to manually download the .pck files and add them themselves. Your games would undoubtedly be a superb addition to these handheld devices. 

    Please note, we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.

    Thank you for considering our request! 

    Best regards,
    Tim
