For Itchi.io version, you have to extract the exe file with 7zip or similar applications and get the files (data.win and all ogg files) 

For Android APK version, you open the .apk as an archive with a program like 7zip, navigate into the "assets" folder, then extract the .ogg files and the "data.droid" file. Finally, "data.droid" needs to be rename "data.win".

After, you need to copy data.win and all ogg files to gamedata folder.
