## Port Update Notes

 - updated 10/14/25
 - updated from older gmloader to gmloadernext (now supports more devices/OS/abxy-swap)
 - reworked ratio..took away the 640x480 ratio lock patch
 - ratio now at 426x240..scales near perfect on larger screens/scaling nicely on 640x480 and other sizes (no more artifacts/shimmering/tearing)
 - set interpolate & interpolatePixels to ON & set a few other tweaks from within UTMT
 - fixed controls..(now using gptk) disabled native controls with wonky behavior on certain OS 
 - tested on multiple operating systems using multiple devices
 
  This update will hopefully make this an all around, more enjoyable port.
