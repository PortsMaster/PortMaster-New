    <desc>You are Izel, and your passion is studying the stars. But your discoveries threaten the power of the high priests. They destroy your research and sentence you to execution.
Escape from jail and take up your spear -- fight your way through underwater caverns, coral reefs, a nest of electric eels, a sunken ship and more. Collect upgrades and abilities to open new paths and find your way home.</desc>
