## Notes

Thanks to [Foxoft](https://vk.com/chaifoxes) for creating this fantastic game, which you can claim free on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/781440/OH_MY_GOD_LOOK_AT_THIS_KNIGHT)

Note that widescreen ROCKNIX devices may experience graphical glitches in the 'pillar-box' area of the screen during cutscenes, but this shouldn't obscure anything and will disappear when gameplay resumes.
