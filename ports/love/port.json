It has a custom respawn system, 16 levels, 12 track original soundtrack, competitive scoring, and multiple ways to play.\nThe difficult levels are balanced with the inclusion of a simple yet unique respawn system wherein the player can leave a checkpoint at any location at any point, as long as they are on solid ground.\nBeyond the visual aesthetic, the challenging level design, and the abundance of features, there is the fantastic soundtrack composed by James Bennett, which brings rich life to the seemingly simple three-color atmosphere.",
