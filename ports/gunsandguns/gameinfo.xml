    <desc>"Guns and Guns" is a personal project that originated during the GMTK jam as "Overgun," albeit with a temporary title placeholder. Departing from traditional shooting mechanics, this platformer adventure focuses on puzzle-solving with three distinct guns, each presenting its own set of challenges. Players navigate through intricately designed puzzles, exploring innovative twists on the platformer genre.</desc>
