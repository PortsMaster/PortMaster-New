texture_bilinear_help		Still ugly: textures are filtered, but still no detail level is selected. Not recommended.

texture_mipmap_nearest_text	Mipmap Nearest
texture_mipmap_nearest_help	No filtering, but detail level (MipMap) selection. If you use software rendering and want to see textures, use this mode.

texture_mipmap_bilinear_text	Mipmap Bilinear
texture_mipmap_bilinear_help	Filtering and detail level selection. Not perfect, but usable on older 3D-accelerators.

texture_mipmap_trilinear_text	Mipmap Trilinear
texture_mipmap_trilinear_help	Filtering and interpolation between detail levels. Looks smoothest and is as fast as "Mipmap Bilinear" on most newer 3D-cards. Some renderers ignore this feature.


#screen mode menu
screen_resolution_text		Screen Resolution:
screen_resolution_help		Selects the screen resolution. Changes will be be applied the next time you start \g or when you select "Apply Changes" below.

window_size_text		Window Size:
window_size_help		Selects the window size. Changes will be be applied the next time you start \g or when you select "Apply Changes" below.

screen_custom_text		Custom
screen_custom_help		Set the variables CUSTOM_SCREEN_WIDTH and CUSTOM_SCREEN_HEIGHT in user.cfg to adjust you custom screen size.

screen_fullscreen_text		Fullscreen:
screen_fullscreen_help		This toggles fullscreen and window mode. As with resolution changes. You have to exit and re-enter \g or select "Apply Changes" for this to have an effect.

screen_colordepth_text		Colour Depth:
screen_colordepth_help		Choose the colour depth you want \g to run at. You have to exit and reenter \g or select "Apply Changes" for this to have an effect. 

screen_colordepth_16_text	16 Bit
screen_colordepth_16_help	Generally considered low quality; but \g does not use many blending effects, so it looks quite OK.

screen_colordepth_desk_text	Default
screen_colordepth_desk_help	Your system's default colour depth; usually the same you have on your desktop.

screen_colordepth_32_text	32 Bit
screen_colordepth_32_help	High quality.

screen_zdepth_text			Z Buffer Depth:
screen_zdepth_help			Depth of the z buffer; determines the quality of depth sorting. You have to exit and reenter \g or select "Apply Changes" for this to have an effect. 

screen_zdepth_16_text		16 Bit
screen_zdepth_16_help		Not recommended, as it will not work most of the time.

screen_zdepth_desk_text		Default
screen_zdepth_desk_help		Take z buffer depth from colour depth; this is the most compatible option.

screen_zdepth_32_text		32 Bit
screen_zdepth_32_help		Force 32 bit z-buffer. If it works, it will improve the quality in 16 bit colour depth.

screen_check_errors_text	Check Errors:
screen_check_errors_help	Should we listen to the warnings about non-existent video modes during initialisation? Usually, you should leave this option alone.

screen_use_sdl_text		Use SDL OpenGL:
screen_use_sdl_help		Toggles use of the clean OpenGL initialisation routines; if disabled, \g will use the dirty method that was necessary with SDL 1.0.

screen_grab_mouse_text		Grab Mouse:
screen_grab_mouse_help		If activated, the mouse pointer is centered after every move; thus, it is unable to leave the window. This option is only useful when you play \g in a window.

screen_apply_changes_text	Apply Changes
screen_apply_changes_help	Tries to enable the settings in this menu without exiting \g. Use at your own risk.

screen_keep_window_active_text   Keep Window Active
screen_keep_window_active_help   This toggles if \g should stay active when window mode is selected and \g loses focus.

#detail menu
detail_floor_mirror_text	Floor Mirror:
detail_floor_mirror_help	Which objects should have reflections on the floor?

detail_floor_mirror_off_text	Off
detail_floor_mirror_off_help	None

detail_floor_mirror_obj_text	Objects only
detail_floor_mirror_obj_help	All moving objects

detail_floor_mirror_ow_text	Objects and Walls
detail_floor_mirror_ow_help	Everything that is important in the game

detail_floor_mirror_ev_text	Everything!
detail_floor_mirror_ev_help	(Currently no difference to "Objects and Walls".)

detail_simple_trail_text    Simple Trails:
detail_simple_trail_help    If activated, cycle trails are displayed in a simplified form without the buildup after the cycle.

detail_dither_text		Dithering:
detail_dither_help		If the colour depth of your current graphic mode does not directly allow the colour that is to be drawn, it is simulated by mixing other colours. Turning it of will improve software rendering performance on some systems; in low resolution modes, turning it off will even improve the visual quality (IMHO).

detail_floor_text		Floor Detail:
detail_floor_help		Armagetron Advanced has several ways to draw the floor and the grid; the better looking ones will cost you some FPS (Frames Per Second).

detail_floor_no_text		No Floor
detail_floor_no_help		Draw nothing at all. Fastest possibility.

detail_floor_grid_text		Just Grid
detail_floor_grid_help		Only a grid of lines is drawn. This option is your choice if you use software rendering.

detail_floor_tex_text		Textured Plane
detail_floor_tex_help		An infinite plane is drawn, with the texture of the grid painted on it. Recommended for all 3D-card owners. Problem: looking at the horizon, the grid will lose its sharpness too fast.

detail_floor_2tex_text		Dual Texture Plane
detail_floor_2tex_help		Just as in "Textured Plane", the floor is an infinite textured plane. But here, the two groups of lines are drawn in two separate rendering steps, resulting in a much sharper image.

detail_alpha_text		Alpha Blending:
detail_alpha_help		Alpha blending is used to display half-transparent objects such as explosions and the walls rising behind the cycles. It does not cost extra with most 3D-cards, but slows software rendering down quite a bit.

detail_smooth_text		Smooth Shading:
detail_smooth_help		Makes edges appear "round" by adding a colour gradient to the surfaces. Even software rendering is not slowed down by activating this.

detail_text_truecolor_text	TrueColour Textures:
detail_text_truecolor_help	Stores the textures with 32 bit colour depth instead of the default of 16 bit.

#preferences menu
pref_sparks_text		Sparks:
pref_sparks_help		Glowing sparks fly from your vehicle whenever you nearly crash.

pref_explosion_text		Explosion:
pref_explosion_help		Toggles the explosion animation when a cycle crashes.

pref_skymove_text		Sky Movement:
pref_skymove_help		Toggles the animation of the lower sky plane.

pref_lowersky_text		Lower Sky:
pref_lowersky_help		Toggles the display of the lower sky plane, a plasma cloud. Turning both sky planes on hurts performance.

pref_uppersky_text		Upper Sky:
pref_uppersky_help		Toggles the display of the upper sky, a solid plane similar to the floor. Turning both sky planes on hurts performance.

pref_highrim_text		High Rim:
pref_highrim_help		If enabled, the rim walls will have infinite height. If not, they will be about as high as player walls.

pref_headlight_text		Show Headlight:
pref_headlight_help		Render a headlight in front of each cycle.  Requires support by your video card.

pref_showhud_text		Show HUD
pref_showhud_help		If enabled, a heads up display will be shown while playing in single user mode.

pref_showfastest_text		Show Fastest
pref_showfastest_help		Shows the fastest player so far on the grid in a game (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showscore_text 		Show Score
pref_showscore_help		Shows your score and the top score in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showenemies_text		Show Enemies
pref_showenemies_help		Shows how many players are still alive (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showtime_text		Show Time:
pref_showtime_help		Show the current time of day on the HUD.

pref_show24hour_text    Show 24 Hour Clock:
pref_show24hour_help	Shows the clock as a 24 hour clock, if enabled.  Set this to 'off' to show the clock as a 12 hour clock.

pref_showping_text		Show Ping
pref_showping_help		Shows your ping in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showbrake_text		Show Brake Meter
pref_showbrake_help		Shows your brake depletion state in a meter in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showspeed_text		Show Speed Meter
pref_showspeed_help		Shows your speed in a meter in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showrubber_text		Show Rubber Meter
pref_showrubber_help		Shows the status of your rubber in a meter in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

misc_fps_text			Show FPS:
misc_fps_help			Toggles the display of the current FPS (frames per second) rate in the upper right corner (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

misc_recording_time_text			Show Recording Time:
misc_recording_time_help			Toggles the display of the current running time of a recording in the upper right corner.

#tweaks menu
tweaks_displaylists_text	Display Lists:
tweaks_displaylists_help	Display lists are a feature of OpenGL for rendering the same thing many times. Some implementations are broken; if you do no see the cycles, you should disable this feature.
tweaks_displaylists_off_text Off
tweaks_displaylists_off_help Don't use display lists at all.
tweaks_displaylists_cac_text Create and Call
tweaks_displaylists_cac_help Use displaylists; Create them and call them directly. This is the recommended way.
tweaks_displaylists_cae_text Create and Execute
tweaks_displaylists_cae_help Use displaylists; Create them and let them be executed while they are filled. The experts say this is slower than Create and Call.

tweaks_infinity_text		Infinity:
tweaks_infinity_help		Some planes (grid, sky...) have an infinite extension; if this feature is enabled, they are really drawn as infinite planes. Some OpenGL renderers do not seem to like this (all Windows versions I have seen...); disable it if the floor or sky textures are screwed up.

fullscreen_message_title        Server Message

network_message_timeout_title	Server does not answer
network_message_timeout_inter	The server you wanted to connect to did not answer for ten seconds.\nIt is probably down or unreachable, or you mistyped its name in the "custom connect" menu.

network_message_denied_title	Login denied
network_message_denied_inter	The server you wanted to connect to denied your login attempt.\nThat usually means it is full.
network_message_denied_inter2	The server you wanted to connect to denied your login attempt.

network_message_lateto_title	Timeout
network_message_lateto_inter	Connection to the server was initially successful; however, synchronising the gamestate failed.\nJust try again!

network_message_lostconn_title	Connection lost
network_message_lostconn_inter	The network connection to the server was lost. This may be due to a real network failure (Ethernet-cable plugged out, modem lost link, ...) or because of a server crash (That would be bad, so please send a bug report if it happens.)

network_message_abortconn_title	Connection terminated
network_message_abortconn_inter	The server terminated our connection.

network_master_timeout_retry	One of the master servers did not answer. Trying next one...\n
network_master_timeout_title	Master servers do not answer
network_master_timeout_inter	The master servers could not be reached and the server list could not be updated. You'll browse the old list for now.\n\nThe most likely reason for this is a problem with your network. Please check\n- that you have a working internet connection: point your web browser to www.armagetronad.net to test.\n- that your firewall, if you have one, does not block our traffic. To test whether this is your problem, disable your firewall and try again. If it then works, you should re-enable the firewall, but allow Armagetron traffic specifically: Armagetron uses UDP and usually ports 4533 to 4540. Personal firewalls also have the possibility to block connections based on program names; make sure that armagetronad(.exe) is unblocked.\nIf you don't control parts of the network connection, say because you're at a public WLAN hot spot or in a company or school network, chances are the owner of the network purposefully blocks UDP traffic. You'll need to talk to the owner, then.\nA last possible, but unlikely, cause is that the master server infrastructure is currently down completely. Visit the forums at forums3.armagetronad.net or the IRC channel #armagetron on irc.freenode.net to see if anyone else has this problem currently.

network_master_denied_title		Master login denied
network_master_denied_inter		The master server denied your login attempt. That usually means it is full. Try again later.

testing_version_expired_title   Version Expired
testing_version_expired         You are running a public test version or an unsupported CVS build. The server you tried to connect to is running a much newer version and that combination is only supported for major releases. An update is probably available for you on www.armagetronad.net or beta.armagetronad.net.
