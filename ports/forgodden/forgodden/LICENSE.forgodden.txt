Hellos,

This game is really awesome, I am currently working to port this game to retro arm linux-based handhelds via portmaster and I am wondering if you are okay with the distribution of the game via Portmaster, or would you prefer users to download the gamefiles from here directly?

Thanks! That's so cool! Hmm, I honestly don't really know much about portmaster. I know GM has a linux export, but I don't have linux personally so I cannot test it. The source code is on github (linked at the top of the page). Maybe it runs from that?
