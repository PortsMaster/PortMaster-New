The open exit lets the player leave a level. Some levels also require
the player to guide some friends (penguins, for example) to the exit.
In these levels, the player can leave through the exit, but the level
is not solved before the last friend also left the level through the
exit.

This exit is made of steel and is indestructible.
It disappears when the player is passing through it.
