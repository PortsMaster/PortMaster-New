    <desc>BOOTLEG BOX is a retro pastiche of bootleg NES/Famicom multicarts and unlicensed games - featuring:

ULTRA PADDLES
CYBER ATTACK
CHOMP'S PUZZLE
NUCLEAR CODES
EGGSELENT

These small games are designed to feel retro-yet-smooth, with streamlined controls, and colourful, sometimes toy-like art. Difficulty ramps up over time. Best suited to killing time during lunch breaks or something, idk.

Everything should be pretty well optimised, and each game responds to the same control scheme as outlined in the main menu.</desc>
