The Story revolves around a fictional videogame character trying to survive with his last life.\n\nThe gameplay of Little Runmo - The Game, is based on the video but also takes inspiration from the Super Mario games. For fans that come from the animation, the game is not a 1 to 1 replica of the animated film. I am not trying to make this a hardcore Meatboy-type game, I want to introduce challenging moments but I will try to make the difficulty curve as smooth as possible.\n\nThe early game will be pretty chill, just imagine how the Mario games were designed, then newer harder mechanics get slowly introduced. Big inspirations again were Mario World and Super Mario Bros Wii and also a fan-game called Mario 63.",
