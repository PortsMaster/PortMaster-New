This is, of course, not as easy as it sounds; Xye must solve all sorts of puzzles while at the same time avoiding all sorts of traps and beasts. Xye is similar to other puzzle games like Sokoban or Boulder Dash, yet it also includes some arcade elements. Xye is a derivative of a classic Windows game called Kye, which is the base of the gameplay experience and visual elements. Xye is able to play level files that were made for Kye and Sokoban.",
