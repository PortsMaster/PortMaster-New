<!---xyeskin, specify an image file (which must be in the same folder and be of png format) and the size of the grid-->
<!---You can also customize the font for some reason.-->
<!--- You can use the bitmaps fonts, this way you may remove the SDL_ttf requirement but also remove the international
  compatibility, bitmap fonts must be bmp, and there are samples in this folder, do not specify truetypesize if you
  do not want a truetype font-->
