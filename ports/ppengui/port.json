Flaming thugs have cut off your nap and now are destroying the silent cave.\n\nHelp the penguin to end the party before things get too hot!\n\n \n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nEliminate all invaders using your egg bomb, but beware of hot areas as you will have difficulty moving through them.\n\nYou can restore the ice using your snotty sneeze. It will undo the heat and can also block enemies.\n\nIn case you end up getting stuck, sneeze over a block to break it. Use the bomb timer to your advantage.. also it is possible to push it forward in order to make a surprise attack!",
