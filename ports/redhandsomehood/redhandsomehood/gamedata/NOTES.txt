 Red Handsome Hood 2015-2017 c Bolhut
===================================
Version 1.3

DEAR PLAYER!
========================

We hope that you have fun playing our game! 

Red Handsome Hood is a game that started one day talking to my mom, I was stuck and didnt know what to make, so she told me
"Why dont you make something that is not super violent, like a game based on a kids tale!"
To what I replied
"Yeah right! Let me just make a very strong Red Riding Hood beating wolves up"

And after a single prototype, development begun. Since then our goal was to make a game with few controls and challenging;
trying to make it not too complicated (which I do not know if we achieved) just so my mom can play it as well.

The game has a story btw! I just decided not to tell anyone, what is your version?

We'd love to hear from you!

Thanks for playing!

The developer, Gifte
