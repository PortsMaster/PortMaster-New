Thanks for the reply! Honestly I think having to get the files from the official source would be ideal for us, but I would be OK if you distributed Red Handsome Hood with appropriate credit & link to its itchio.

Dear Jaime,

In order to get Red Handsome Hood, one of the other developers have managed to patch it in order to unencrypt the save file due to the nature of the translation layer.
I do hope you are still okay with a distribution of a “patched” Red Handsome Hood. If not, then we will get users to download the files from itch.io straight.
