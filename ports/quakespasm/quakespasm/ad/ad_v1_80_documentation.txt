MOD settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several different places (RC/Map/Console) where the MOD settings can
be changed and some locations have precedent over others. The MOD will initially
look to the quake.rc file first, worldspawn second and finally the console
commands third. The higher levels will always override lower levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 - quake.rc
The first place where settings can be changed is the Quake.RC file which is
located in the root directory of the MOD. The file contains full details of
what settings can be changed and what values to use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 - World/Map
When a map is loaded the worldspawn entity can have the following settings
which will override any quake.rc settings. These options below will affect
all clients (SP / Coop / DM ) and can even give / take items.

float gravity;                  // gravity of map (default = 800)
string fog;                     // console command (Den/R/G/B - '0.05 0.3 0.3 0.3')
float fog_density;              // Global fog density (works with trigger_fog)
vector fog_colour;              // Global fog colour (XYZ = RGB)
string fog_dpextra;             // extra DP fog parameters, default - '1 0 8192 1024 32'
string water_alpha;             // Water Alpha, default - 1.00
float particlemax;              // Amount of ACTIVE particles per map

float no_item_rotate;           // Not used anymore, kept for compatibility
float no_zaware;                // Switch OFF zaware monster attacks
float no_sgprojectile;          // Switches OFF ALL shotgun projectiles
float no_sgcasing;              // Switches OFF ALL shotgun casings
float no_liquiddmg;             // Switch OFF liquid (slime/lava) monster damage
float knight_defskin;           // Default skin for new red shoulder knight model
float bodyflrcheck;             // Stationary and Dead monsters do floor checks
float bodyfadeaway;             // Dead monster bodies fade away (secs)
float sprite_particles;         // Switch all custom particles to sprites (builtin excluded)

Entity State System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Quake first came out there were strict limitations on how many entities
could exist and be active at the same time. The quick fix solution to this
problem was to use the killtarget key so that entities could be removed. 
This was a very powerful feature with very few restrictions on what it 
could affect or destroy at the same time.

The idea of the entity state system is to create a way to safely switch
entities on, off or have then temporarily disabled. This will help prevent
situations where entity chains are broken or strange errors occur because
the touch function does not have an entity anymore.

There are two ways to change the state of any entity as follows:

Method 1
--------
Add an extra key on triggering entities (_once, _multi, _relay etc) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float estate_trigger;           // new entity key command
  = 1;                          // Switch ON  -Added to world
  = 2;                          // Switch OFF -Removed from world
  = 4;                          // Disabled   -blocks entity functionality
  = 8;                          // Reset      -reset back to spawn state
  = 16;                         // Aframe     -change aframe state

The ON state (default) will allow the entity to work as designed, be
toggled and physically exist as per its setup.

The OFF state will block all of the designed functionality and hide 
the entity from interaction with the world/player.

The DISABLE state blocks any toggle ability or entity functionality
and turns off any visual aids like animated textures.

The RESET state will revert the entity back to the state it was in when
starting the map. There are exceptions, it does not work on every entity.
  
The AFRAME state will allow certain entities to change to exact frame
states. This is only supported on a few entity types at the moment.
  
Method 2
--------
Use one of the new triggering entities listed below:
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
trigger_entitystate_on          // Switch the target(s) ON
trigger_entitystate_off         // Switch the target(s) OFF
trigger_entitystate_disable     // DISABLE the target(s)
trigger_entitystate_reset       // RESET the target(s)
trigger_entitystate_aframe      // Change AFRAME of target(s)

These new entities will affect multiple targets and are designed to show
(visually) what is happening in the editor by using target lines. They
work/setup very much like a trigger_relay in the editor.



==============================================================================
Starting Point, do you remember me!?!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quake starts in a hub style map with various skill selection portals
and several episodes gates which the player can complete in any order.
Once all of the episodes are completed a final area is unlocked and the
player can beat the final boss and complete the game.

When the player starts the game they begin at the 'info_player_start'
spawn location and once the player has some rune(s) they return to the 
start map using the 'info_player_start2' entity instead.

The start2 system always returns the 'trigger_changelevel' portals to the
same location in the start map. To allow the creation of more detailed
start map layouts there can now be up to seven 'info_player_start2'
locations in the start map which are all linked to different returning
changelevel triggers.

By adding the new key 'startspawn2' to a 'trigger_changelevel' entity
with a unique number (1-7) and then adding the same key and number to an
'info_player_start2' entity in the returning map, the player will start
at the new location instead of the default one.

When the new key 'startspawn2' is used there is no rune check done
anymore and the player will spawn in the next or returning map at a
'info_player_start2' location, the default number is one.

With the ability to create hub maps with multiple returning points there
is now a new 'trigger_rune' entity which can be used to test the players
inventory for runes and trigger different events. This is a touch
trigger unlike the func_episode/boss triggers which only happen at the
beginning when the map is loaded.

All player spawn entities will fire any 'target' triggers when used as a
starting location, this can help fine tune locations ready for the player.

When the end intermission screen is active showing map totals for monsters
killed and secrets found, the intermission camera can cycled around multiple
'info_intermission' locations. When the player looks through these extra
cameras any target keys found are triggered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
info_player_start               // Starting point for players without runes
  string target;                // triggered target(s) when used as a client destination

Trains, Chains and Corners
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many good examples of trains in the original ID maps with some
notable ones being the opening sequence of the Demon door in E1M2 and the
long wandering platforms in E3M4. These are classics because they show the
player that the environment can be more than just doors or buttons and with
a clever use of path corners, things can flow in multiple directions.

The original func_train entity has limited options (start on/off), it was
designed to follow a chain of path corners in loops or pause and stop at
various corners via different wait states.

This MOD has changed the func_train entity so that it can switch paths, 
speed up or slow down, pause at corners, go backwards or forward and
even be invisible! All these extra options are split across both train 
and corner entities with some being used by monsters.

A func_train entity starts as a collection of brushes in the editor which
eventually become a bmodel located at position 0,0,0 and its origin is an
offset of what movement has happened since spawning. Bmodels have collision
on the edges of their bounding boxes and are often used as crushers because
they have no roll back condition.

The new func_trains can be setup with no collision or even have the bmodel
replaced with a model instead! Once the spawnflag MODEL is enabled the train
will default to an empty model (invisible) unless the 'mdl' key is defined. 
This can be useful for the new trap shooters entities because they can now
track moving targets like trains.

The original train entity had restrictions (start on/off) based on the
setting of the 'targetname' key and this has been removed with a new 
spawnflag. The final addition is a new spawnflag to make trains start 
backwards through their entity chains instead of forward.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
func_train                      // Moving bmodels, always start on 2nd frame
  spawnflags STARTON = 1;       // Start moving straight away if targetname is used
  spawnflags NONSOLID = 2;      // No collision or blocking functionality (uses bmodel)
  spawnflags MODEL = 4;         // Model with no collision (use mdl key, def=empty model)
  spawnflags TOUCH = 8;         // Nonsolid or model trains have touch damage (dmg)
  spawnflags REVERSE = 32;      // Start going backward through path_corner chain
  string target;                // Name of first path_corner to start at (instant move)
  string mdl;                   // Specify a model for MODEL mode only (progs/object.mdl)
  float speed;                  // moving speed (def=100)
  float dmg;                    // block damage (def=2)
  float sounds;                 // 0=Silent, 1=Train, 5=Custom sounds
  string noise;                 // custom sound - stopped
  string noise1;                // custom sound - moving (looping)

The real power behind the new func_train entity comes from the new options
available on the path corners and dynamically via triggering entities.
Essentially trains have options for appearance and movement, while the path
corners have options for routes, speed and direction.

* The new functionality of path_corners is designed to work with func_train
entities and most of the new feaures will not work with monsters.

Path corners are usually setup with a 'targetname' and 'target' key which are
linked together with other corners into a large single loop. To create route
variety an alternative route key 'target2' has been added and depending on
which route logic mode is active can be picked randomly or exactly.

As a general rule if a path corner DOES NOT have a second alternative 
'target2' key route defined then there is NO ROUTING LOGIC active. The path
corner is just forward or backward routes dictated by direction flow.

The default route logic mode is RANDOM and when a second route is defined
the train or monster will randomly pick between 'target' and 'target2' keys.
When the train is moving backwards the RANDOM logic mode excludes the current
path direction first and then randomly picks from the remaining two. 

The second route logic mode is EXACT and initially setup via a spawnflag
option. When a train or monster arrives at an EXACT route path corner
they are sent (no choice) in the currently selected route. This mode will
even send a train back the way it came if selected and always change the
direction flow to suit the route taken.

All links backward are automatically generated when the path corners are
spawned. If this process has picking the wrong target (check dev arrows) then
the backward link can be overridden with the 'targetback' key.

The downside to path corner networks is that they do not change, they
are static and cannot be affected by the players actions. Several new keys
have been added that when setup on firing triggers that target path corners
will change internal settings.

The key 'corner_route' will change the path corner to either RANDOM or EXACT
routing logic or a specific route number, as long as the route exists.

The route number on a path corner can either be changed with the new 
'corner_route' key or when the EXACT mode is active and a trigger is fired
at the corner, it will cycle around between the routes. 

The key 'corner_switch' will change the direction of a path corner to
forward or backward routing or toggle the current value. This will affect
any train using this corner and reverse its direction.

The key 'corner_pause' will change the NOPAUSE spawnflag and 'wait' key
to instruct any train to either stop or continue on. The new key supports 
exact values (on/off) or toggles the current state.

The key 'corner_speed' will change the speed on the target path_corner
so that trains can be made to move slower or faster when leaving the
path_corner. Speed value must be greater than 0, default = 100.

The key 'corner_event' is only active on the path corner and acts like
a typical 'target' key on any entity which will trigger target(s) when
any func_train entity is at the path corner.

The 'state' key only works when EXACT logic routing is active and will
setup an initial value for which route is selected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
path_corner                     // Node based path routing system
  spawnflags EXACT = 1;         // Exact route logic (def=random route choices)
  spawnflags INSTANT = 2;       // Move instantly to this corner if next destination
  spawnflags REVERSE = 4;       // Train direction is reversed for next corner
  spawnflags NOPAUSE = 8;       // Train does not pause on this path corner
  string corner_event;          // Name of target(s) to trigger when used/touched
  float corner_route;           // Change path_corner route (1-3 routes, 4=exact, 5=random)
  float corner_switch;          // Change spawnflags REVERSE (-1=NO, 1=YES, 2=Toggle)
  float corner_pause;           // Change spawnflags NOPAUSE (-1=NO, 1=YES, 2=Toggle)
  float corner_speed;           // Change the speed on the path_corner for trains
  float state;                  // Starting route (1=forward, 2=alt forward, 3=backward)
  string target;                // Targetname of FORWARD route
  string target2;               // Alternative FORWARD route
  string targetback;            // Override default BACKWARD route
  float wait;                   // fixed amount of time to pause at corner (=-1 stop)
  float delay;                  // random amount of time to pause at corner
  float alpha;                  // Override default for visual arrows (def=0.35)
  float speed;                  // Override default speed of func_train (def=100)

With all the new options, extra routes and dynamically changing parameters it
is difficult to see what is going on with a path corner network. To help with
this problem when path corners are spawned and developer mode is active, a set
of coloured arrows will be drawn showing status, routes and any errors.

All forward and backward routes will be displayed in yellow, any secondary 
routes 'target2' will be shown in green and currently selected exact logic
routes are displayed in white. All errors are shown in red.

A path corner with a missing 'target' key or a broken back link will be shown
with a red arrow pointing upwards. These path corners are labelled as DEADENDS
and anything arriving at them will be turned around automatically.

The helper arrows on path corners is only displayed when developer mode is
active and can be switched on/off with an impulse command. Check the quake.rc
file for full details of mod commands.

Traps, Tricks and Tips
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is hard to image Quake without some kind of trap, whether it be a spike
shooter hidden on the ceiling or a large pit of lava waiting for one wrong step!
There should be something lurking around a corner, high above the player or
just below waiting to kill the unobservant player.

Breakable System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The breakables system is a way to create interactive environments by opening up
alternative routes, having sudden destructible monster ambushes and encouraging
plenty of rewarding player exploration moments.

func_breakable - is the primary entity of the breakable system
func_breakable_spawner - is a point entity clone of func_breakable
func_breakable_wall - used to fill in the gaps or reveal the details
trigger_monsterbreak - will trigger a breakable and monster together

The breakable system starts with the style key which defines all the defaults
based on material types. Each style has default rubble bmodels, unique 
break/impact sounds, particle effects and different rubble velocity values.

If a different style of breakable is required there are plenty of extra types which
can be specified by the brkobjects key (10-12=rocks, 20-22=woods, 30-32=glass, 
40-42=metals, 50-54=brick) and more will be added over time.

To create your own custom rubble the new bmodels should be setup in sets of 4 
(roughly 8/16/24/32 units in size) and specified with the brkobj1-4 keys.
There are plenty of example map files under the 'maps/brk' directory which
can be re-painted to suit your needs. Always create any custom bmodels in
the map directory so that they can be grouped together with the map files.

It is recommended that all new bmodels be compiled with minimum lighting
using the following command line (tycompiler\light -light 150 %1) The light
value (150) should be changed to suit the location of the breakable.

The breakable system will randomly pick a rubble bmodel from the defined set
and if something is required to be picked more frequently then duplicate the
required bmodel across several of the brkobj keys.

When a breakable is triggered or the health reaches zero the initial bmodel is
removed and any targets are fired. This is to make sure that any broken detail
is present before any rubble is generated. The system will then try 
(up to 4 times) to spawn rubble inside of the original bmodel volume.

When a monster is pursuing the player and finds a breakable in the way they
will try to destroy it using either melee or range attacks. If the breakable
is for scripted events only then add the extra spawnflags noshoot and nomonster
to prevent any unscripted interactions.

When a breakable is damaged and not destroyed the system shows feedback to the 
player with specially coloured particles instead of the default white ones
used for world geometry. All of the default material styles have particle
colours setup and this can be fine tuned with the entity key pos1.

Breakables inside of liquids (underwater) will break apart at the same velocity
as anywhere else in the map and can be fine tuned either by changing the 
velocity keys (brkvelbase, brkveladd) or by changing the gravity (brkgravity)
of rubble so that it falls slower.

The default velocity for the rubble is a directional force and this is based on
the angle of impact or the triggering entity. The angle of velocity can be
changed by moving around the trigger so that the rubble can fall in more visually
impressive ways. The system also supports the angle key on the original bmodel and
this will override any directional force. The angle key set to 1-360 will produce
a flat (XY) velocity, an up direction is like a fountain from the center and a 
downward angle is without any XY movement. Depending on where the player is in 
relation to the breakble when it falls apart, a special angle key setup might 
produce better visual results.

There are plenty of monsters that have jumping abilities and their collision
detection does not always produce perfect results. It is possible to setup
breakables with an extra touch function that will detect jumping monsters and
break apart if a flying monster hits them and the (brktrigjump) key active.

Particle System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The particle system is OFF by default because it can easily bring a Quake
engine to its knees with over use. When the system is active it will create
a large bank (1000) of particles to minimize entity thrashing. All requests
for a particle goes through a single system that does all the work fetching,
re-using and configuring all particles ready for use.

The system comes in two different flavours (pixel sprites and alpha textures)
which are automatically switched between when the correct engine is detected.
This allows for one map to work with multiple clients and minimize the
effort involved in getting a map looking good with multiple engines.

There are several predefined particle setups which can be triggered via a 
'misc_particle' entity or if they are not right a new particle can be setup
with the template system that copies all of its settings to any particle
entity that targets it when the map starts.

Quake does come with a small set of builtin particle effects that are used
throughout the game by monsters or map specific events. Using the new entity
'misc_builtineffects' the ID effects can easily be triggered.

The Darkplaces engine uses alpha texture particles which allows for one of
the best kind of particles, smoke! The new entity 'misc_smoke' is designed
to take advantage of that with multiple colours, different spread patterns
and velocity directions.

==============================================================================
BASE AD Monsters

monster_army (_rocket, _grenade, _plasma)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Low health cannon fodder with various weapon upgrades and different coloured
armour to fill up early base levels with. The rocket version has a small amount
of target seeking, the grenades are Z aware and the plasma is high damage!

monster_enforcer (_defender, _pyro, _eliminator, _centurion)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large battalion of dual shock defenders, high burst plasma eliminators, floating
high centurions and firey flamethrowing enforcers. With a gradually inclining range
of HP bars and jigsaw like large pack encounter designs, this is a formidable 
front line defence force!

monster_jim
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A fast moving flying robot that can easily avoid players projectile attacks
with a special upward move and still keep firing lasers or rockets. The speed
of the projectiles and movement are linked to skill levels which can be a
challenge when encountered in large packs.

monster_freddie
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Large ogre fused to a rusty industrial exoskeleton, with various weapons
grafted to both arms forcing it to open cans of food with its teeth! Either
has a Super Nail gun or a Laser Chain gun as a primary weapon.

monster_seeker
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large grey looking robot with a distinct whirling sound and sparking noise
if one of its arms is missing. Can be setup to start with a blue shield and
wait to be activated with a trigger event. Either arm can be removed on
spawn and used as a way to balance different skill levels. Has a powerful
melee attack when both arms are attached and can lose arms during combat.
Will switch from lasers to fast moving plasma bolts for higher skill
levels and has a slow moving rocket attack for distance.


==============================================================================
CRITTER AD Monsters

monster_lostsoul
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lost soul is inspired by the equilivant monster from Doom and features
all the same attacks and abilities. A floating skull which wanders around,
rushes the player if seen and can be deadly if within melee range as it
has a nasty frenzy like bite attack.

monster_scorpion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The brown/green (default) scorpion is very slow moving and prefers to throw
acid coloured spikes at the player. A low health enemy with an easily dodged
range attack, but a lethal claw melee attack.

The black version is much tougher on health and will jump extremely quickly
at the player with a deadly poison tail sting. The players health will be
reduced by 50% each sting and gradually restore back 5HP per second afterwards.
Best setup in very dark corners ready for any unsuspecting players, produces a
very distinct idle sound designed to induce fear of attack.

monster_spider
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The brown (default) spider is melee only and will erratically move towards
the player with a tame jump attack for close encounters. The green (large)
spider prefers to stay at range and spit at the player with 3 blobs of acid.
The spit function will track the player and is ZAware.

The spider bite is low damage 1-3 per 5 frames with a special frenzy attack. This
can be lethal in large groups as the spider also pushes forward at the same time.
The jump attack is 5-10 damage, half that of a dog. Can be setup to spawn on
the ceiling and triggered to drop on unobservant players.

monster_voreling / monster_swampling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mini three legged ankle biting vorelings are fast moving with a small sized
jump and frenzy bite attack for snacking. They speed up and slow down while
they run and will often pause if at distance from the player. They have very
low health and are designed to be encountered in packs. Can be setup to spawn
on the ceiling and triggered to drop on unobservant players.

There is a large spawnflag option which spits projectiles and stays at distance
and the swamplings are all poisonous with their bite/projectile attacks.


==============================================================================
MEDIEVAL AD Monsters

monster_boil
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A slow moving explosive enemy that can do massive amounts of damage to other
monsters. Can be setup to walk around, be hobbled to the ground or staked
to a wall. Has a spit projectile if stationary to attract attention to
itself and be a warning to players. Best dealt with by a NG/SNG because its
a small bounding box or use a GL for one hit explosions.

monster_dcrossbow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cautious range unit with high damage bolts and a strong melee attack. The
bolts are variable speed based on skill level and are designed to force the
player to strafe or seek cover. The health bar can easily be taken down
with NG+ weapons, but SG\SSG will struggle because of reload times.

When the player is within melee range the unit will use the crossbow as a club
and as soon outside of range straight away fire a bolt for a quick hipshot.
Unlike most monsters in Quake the crossbow knight will not immediately follow
the player but rather wait and keep distance.

It is recommended to place these units around sharp corners (90 degree)
or up on ledges overlooking areas. The crossbow knight does not follow the
same way as other quake units and needs to be in position first.

monster_dguard
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A medieval version of the 'monster_army' unit with low health and knight like
melee damage. Good for starting areas and general filler to existing groups.
Designed to be an easy introduction to the Death Brigade with fast movement. 

monster_dknight
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A model upgrade with more polygon detail, plenty of extra idle animations and
all the standard ID hell knight attacks.

monster_dfury
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A mid level monster with shalrath/demon like health bar that has five melee
attacks and two very quick firing magic attacks. Designed to jump close to
the player and use multiple quick sword swings for high damage. Will use
two types of magic attacks at mid to long range that have slow build up
animations that fire variable speed projectiles dependant on skill level.

The fury knight will easily work its way through a crowded room doing extra
damage against other monsters and using its over head smash attack for
visual affect. It has a high pain threshold for small impact damage, but
can be dealt with easily with SNG/GL/RL heavy attacks.

monster_dsergeant
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A fast moving Blue Flail knight with shalrath homing missiles and heavy
single strike melee attacks. This unit will constantly charge the player if the
Z height is similar and if different keep send deadly homing missiles instead.
This is a mid level monster that is highly mobile, crushing up close and
will easily tear a path through any crowd to get its target.

The homing missiles have the same speed regardless of skill level. Originally
these were setup identical to the Shalrath with easy/normal/hard being different
to the nightmare skill level. During testing it felt like the missiles were
going faster than usual because the blue knight moves around so quick, this
is the reason the missiles use only one speed.

monster_drole
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large hulking tank of tentacles with a tendency to get angry at the player
with sometimes deadly results. This monster has two phases, the first is to
keep mid range distance and fire rapidly increasing fireballs. There is no
strafe mode but instead the monster will physically turn and walk around
to the side waiting for the cooldown on range attacks.

The second phase is the enrage at 70% health the drole will switch to a
very fast run attack (demon/fiend speed) and constantly try to pummel the
player with a wall of tentacles. The second phase is really to apply the
pressure to the player and make them panic.

monster_gargoyle
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A tough flying unit with a single range attack (fireball) that prefers to keep
its distance from ground enemies. The fireball does 25% damage compared to a
player rocket with direct and splashdamage to encourage infighting.

The gargoyle will always try to maintain height above its enemies to reduce
melee damage and works best when in areas with high ceilings. If the enemy
is within close range, will fire rapid shots instead.

monster_gaunt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large Cthulhu like Pterodactyl with an creepy calling sound and the ability
to transmute electricity into fast moving bolts of plasma. Will always hover
above the player and can be setup in a perch state for surprise attacks.

monster_golem
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A slow moving mountain of rock with giant fists and large feet that can easily
destroy any enemies that get too close. The Golem has several strong melee
attacks, one large radius ground shockwave attack and the ability to throw a
large volley of bone breaking rock debris.

monster_hogre
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new model with greater detail and some armour pieces similar to the Hell
Knight. There are three different types; chainsaw, mace and hammer. Each
ogre can be upgraded (skin) with a new spawnflag that gives an extra HP boast.

The chainsaw version has an extra thrust attack which does +150% damage. The
mace ogre does high single strike attacks and the hammer version has a special
shockwave attack which lifts everything nearby off the ground.

monster_minotaur
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An extremely tall demonic beast with a powerful melee attack and very fast
plasma/poison attack. This monster has two phases likes the drole and will
eventually switch to a very fast charge/melee attack when enraged.

monster_shambler (by Renier "Skiffy" Banninga)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This set of files are designed as a new HD replacement for the default Quake
Shambler.MLD which I've always found to be one of the weakest models in the game.
made monster models in the game. This model was created with the purpose of
finally giving the shambler its visual fidelity deserving of such a large
and terrifying brute while still staying within the limits of Vanilla quake.

The original Shambler has 284 triangles which is less than half the amount used
on the dog model. The new Shambler uses 992 triangles which is a little less than 
double the amount used on the beloved dog. He uses a 256 x 256 texture which conforms
to GL texture size standards unlike the 308 x 115 texture size of the original.
Considering his overall size and rarity in the game these upgrades specs would
work just fine in the original game. It is still within the limits of stock Quake.

Animation has been completely redone and was made in such a way to work with the
originals size and AI motions. Some fixes have been done for the movement and
attack animations. He no longer hits high up in the air for the walking slash
attacks and should have most if not all sliding feet issues removed or reduced.
His overhead smash has also been shifted one frame to sync up more with the damage
trigger and features a less floaty death animation. Overall it should read a bit 
more solid.

h_shams.mdl has also received a visual makeover to be consistent with the updated
shambler model. I tried to make it look a little more mauled to help convey that
a serious amount of damage was required to gib the Shambler. There also supports 
Arcane Dimensions custom gib models adding 2 feet and claw gore meshes when
gibbing the shambler.

The Boglord (larger shambler) and re-colouring of skins for monster+gibs
was done by me (simonoc) after receiving the final models from Renier.

monster_wraith
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A semi-transparent flying apparition with multiple range attacks that will
try to stay out of melee range and high above the player as much as possible.
The primary attack is a hitscan burning debuff that does direct fire damage
and then sets fire to the player with damage over time afterward.

The burning debuff will ignores all armour and is deflected by the Pentagram
of Protection and Environment Suit. The screen will flash orange every second
and a loud heartbeat sound can be heard in background while the health is
being drained. The player can use health packs to instantly stop the burning.

Once the debuff has been applied to the player the wraith will start attacking
with a burst of bones (nails) to keep the player pre-occupied with dodging.

The wraith is designed to be a support class monster that lurks in the
background helping an existing encounter by disorientating the player with
large fire attacks and slow burning damage.

monster_zombiek
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A slow moving zombie with a knight sword in one hand and counter balance club foot.
Has a small leap forward when close to the player and requires large hit damage to die.
Designed to be lurking in the shadows or part of a pack of monsters as it is good
at applying pressure to an already active combat situation. Can start/spawn
lying down and then be triggered later.

==============================================================================
Minion System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This system is designed to work with specific monsters and spawn certain 
monsters, this is not a global function for all monsters. The idea is to create 
a support class, a strong HP monster that stays at mid range and keep spawning 
low health monsters that will create more chaotic encounter groups.

Minion spawning monsters on their own are easy to deal with, their spawning is
slow and they rarely use any kind of direct damage attack.  It is essential that
these monsters are placed at the edge of encounters so that any monsters they
do spawn can join the encounter easily.

The primary concern with the minion spawning mechanic is that the player can
eventually run out of ammo and the endless spawning can eventually crash the
engine. This is solved by two mechanics, a limit to how many minions are
active at once and trigger events based on quantity spawned so far.

The defaults can be changed by adding the following keys to the monster:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float minion_maxcount;          // Maximum amount of active minions (def=3/5)
float minion_maxtrigger;        // Spawn total for trigger event (def=5)
string miniontarget;            // targetname string for trigger event

Once the monster reaches the maximum active amount of minions it will go into
wandering phase of maintaining distance from the enemy and start using a
range attack so that it looks like it is doing something. The spawning monster
will not spawn any minions unless it can see the player.

The default throw parameters are quiet low (100-150 speed) and this can be
problem if the minion spawner is on a high ledge. The following parameters will
change the default throw distance and fix any stuck problems. 

How to change the throw speed of the ball/egg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float minion_throwspeed;        // Forward speed of ball to be thrown (def=100)
float minion_throwextra;        // Random forward momentum (def=50)
float minion_throwside;         // Random +/- sideways momentum (def=50)

If the player gets within melee range there is a chance that the
minion spawner will revert to the monsters original base attack. This can be 
blocked with the following parameter, otherwise it is on by default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
float minion_baseattack = -1;   // Block base attack within melee range

Every minion spawning monster requires a special entity that must be added to
the map so that all the correct precache files are loaded. If the entity is not
present when the monster tries to spawn a minion, a dev console message will be
displayed and the monster will not spawn anything!

Here is a list of the new entities (named after spawning monster)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
monster_minotaurminion          // Gargoyle precache for the Minotaur
monster_shalrathminion          // Vorling precache for the shalrath
monster_skullwizminion          // Lost Soul precache for the Skull Wizard
monster_wraithminion            // Spider precache for the wraith
monster_wraithminion2           // Scorpion precache for the wraith

The spawning minion function only works against the player, if the monster is
caught infighting it will revert to its typical range attacks until the
fight is over. Then it will switch back to the player and resume spawning.

Here is a list of available minion spawning monsters:

monster_minotaur
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large hulking demonic beast with strong melee attacks, large feet and the
chance to throw very fast plasma or poison bolts at the player. The dark brown
version loves to summon gargoyles out of thin air!

monster_shalrath
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A classic ID monster with three legs, a rough voice and a tendency to throw
homing missiles that love to chase players around tiny pillars. The purple
skinned version loves to throw baby voreling eggs at the player!

monster_skullwizard
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A turret like dead wizard that fires powerful skull rockets and when 
the player is too close will teleport away to another location. The black
robe version loves to summon lost souls out of thin air!

monster_wraith
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A semi-transparent flying apparition with multiple range attacks that will
try to stay out of melee range and high above the player. The dark skinned
version loves to throw baby scorpion/spider eggs at the player!


==============================================================================
Bounding Boxes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The quickest way to make the game harder is to change the size of bounding
boxes! All projectiles are tested against a monsters bounding box, which cannot
be rotated, is always centered on the model and XY square in dimensions because
of the rotation problem.

To view ingame bounding boxes use the console command 'r_showbboxes'

All of the bounding boxes have been tweaked to fit the models better, this
will affect how monsters move around (collision) and especially weapons that
have large projectile spread patterns (ie shotguns)

The monsters break down into several categories based on model sizes and
location (ground/air/water). Flying monsters usually have taller bounding
boxes so they can be hit easier from the ground.

Quake maintains two types of collision, projectiles and world (geometry).
The QC can set the projectile collision (see above) but the world collision
is done via the engine. There are currently 3 types of world collision
called Hull 0, 1 and 2. 

Any monster that is wider than 32 units will have a Hull 2 collision which 
is the size of a shambler. This is why ogres, demons and shalraths often 
cannot fit through small doorways even though it looks like they can!

New Weapons
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadow Axe (SA)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new axe is a visual upgrade (blood soaked model) which does +75% more 
damage, kills zombies and deals with low level monsters easily. To some
the axe has always been a novelty weapon, but there are plenty of Quake
players who love to dance around monsters cutting them down to size!

With the increased damage, many of the low level monsters are now one hit
wonders and several of them will now play long pain animations when attacked
with the new axe to allow the player time to get in extra 2nd/3rd fatal hit.
(dcrossbow, enforcer, hogre, knight, ogre, wizard do long pain animations)

The primary benefit of the new axe is against zombies, one hit will often
knock them down to the ground and another will deal with them on the ground.
This also applies to all bodies lying on the floor, so observant players can
preempt traps by dealing with bodies on the floor first.

The Widowmaker (WM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an upgrade to the Super Shotgun (SSG) and does +50% more damage, but
uses +50% more shells (3 per shot). The WM spread pattern is identical to the
SSG and there are now 21 pellets instead of 14 fire every 7 frames.

The WM is designed to be effective against mid range monsters (demon/shalrath)
and less effective against single low level monsters (knight/wizard). This gives
the player more high damage weapon/ammo choices (shells/nails) and extra time to
deal with more powerful enemies quickly. With the same spread pattern as the SSG
and higher damage output the RG can easily deal with multiple small monsters.

One side effect of the higher damage (84) is that the weapon can effectively
kill zombies with one hit and is an ideal early weapon alternative to the GL/RL.

The greatest concern with the WM is the ammo consumption, especially if the 
player is missing many shots or catching the sides of bounding boxes. Extra 
boxes of shell ammo should be setup to delay spawn (via extra keys) if the 
player has the item in their inventory.

Plasma Gun (PG)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an upgrade to the Lightning Gun with extra (splash) damage, the
ability to plasma climb walls and no instant death if fired in water.

==============================================================================
Setting up New Weapons
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This MOD contains several ways to give or take weapon upgrades from the
player during the various stages of the map loading process. 

Stage 1 - TEMP1 in Quake.rc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The temp1 variable in quake.rc has the following parameters:

8192    Turn ON Axe Upgrade, +75% dmg, gib zombies
16384   Turn ON SSG Upgrade, +50% dmg, uses 3 shells
32768   Turn ON LG Upgrade, Plasma projectiles + Splash Damage

Enabling these parameters DOES NOT give the player the upgrade weapon,
it will upgrade the original weapons in any map. For example, if the player
finds the Super Shotgun in a map it will automatically be upgraded to the 
Widowmaker Shotgun instead.

These options are designed for players who want to enjoy maps which don't
have the weapon upgrades entities present, like for example ID maps.

Stage 2 - Worldspawn
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The worldspawn entity of a map has the following parameters:

upgrade_axe  Upgrade Axe -1=remove, 1=enable
upgrade_ssg  Upgrade Super Shotgun -1=remove, 1=enable
upgrade_lg   Upgrade Lightning Gun -1=remove, 1=enable

Not every map is designed for the upgraded weapons and by using the
worldspawn entity, mappers can decide if the upgraded weapons are given
or taken away when the map is started.

These worldspawn parameters will OVERRIDE the temp1 key and any
existing inventory if the player has come from another map. These
parameters will also change the server flags for original weapons
to be upgraded and triggers for special spawn conditions.

Stage 3 - Worldspawn II
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The worldspawn entity also has the following parameters:

give_weapons  Bit flag for which weapons to give to the player
take_weapons  1=SG, 2=SSG, 4=NG, 8=SNG, 16=GL, 32=RL, 64=LG (excludes Axe)

These worldspawn parameters are designed to give exact weapon loadouts
to a new player starting a map. There are also parameters for ammo, health
and armour to customize the player inventory further.

The take weapon command will remove upgraded weapons if the base weapon is
removed by these parameters. For example, if the map removes the SSG, then
the Widowmaker upgrade will be removed at the same time.

Stage 4 - Impulse Commands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These impulse commands are available when developer mode is enabled:

Impulse 200   Upgrade Axe (alias = "upgaxe")
Impulse 205   Upgrade SSG (alias = "upgssg")
Impulse 210   Upgrade LG  (alias = "upglg")

These impulse commands are toggles that will add/remove the relevant
weapon upgrade. These weapons are not part of impulse 9 which is the
general cheat function used for testing.


==============================================================================
Ammo Resistance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I always thought it was odd that the Shambler had 50% resistance to all
rockets. This was never visually shown or hinted at in the game besides the
manual warning about it! I am sure there were plenty of players who never
realized this 'feature' existed.

I am sure some people will scream that a RPG style resistance system has
no place in Quake and maybe they are right, but unfortunately there is 
an exception to the rule, the Shambler!

In an effort to resolve this visual problem a few monsters (high tier)
now have ammo resistance to encourage the player to use different weapons
and manage / collect more ammo types. This is also something a designer
needs to be aware of when balancing a map involving these monsters.

The Shell and Nail visual resistance is shown with a mixture of red and
grey impact particles, a ricochet sound, various smoke chunks flying off
in random directions and the monster screaming in pain.

The Rocket and Cell visual resistance is shown with a small puff of smoke,
a different rocket sound, small gibs of flesh (blood particles look odd),
various smoke chunks flying off in random directions and a monster scream.

When a monster is hit with a projectile and they have ammo resistance they
will ALWAYS ignore pain and not go into any pain animations.
