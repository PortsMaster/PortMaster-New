Simply, two highly rendered CTF skins for the Guard plugin player model (PPM), including icons.
The Guard (which was a baddie in Quake2) PPM can be downloaded from any of the PPM web
pages, such as:

        http://bodyshop.telefragged.com/
        http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp

These skins were created for beta testing PPM's in the official Quake2 CTF, however since
the Guard PPM was never released with CTF, the skins never had any serious use.

CTF skins are, of course, incredibly simple to do (ie. recolour several areas of the skin
to red/blue and bingo!), but I put a bit more work into these skins than a simple recolouring
so hopefully there's some value in releasing.

I do realize the are probably other CTF skins packs for the guard PPM around. This is just
another one.

IMPORTANT STUFF

These skins are an unsupported release. You cannot make money from these skins, nor can you
publish them in any way, shape or form unless you are id Software. Most of the work in these
skins is really that of Adrian Carmack, so copyright belongs to id Software.
