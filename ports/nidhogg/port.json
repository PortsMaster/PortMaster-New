    "desc": "Nidhogg is the epic award-winning fencing tug-of-war, full of graceful acrobatics and clumsy stabs. IRL yelling and excitement may occur, in this ultimate two-player showdown of fast-paced fencing and melee attacks.\nThe combat arena stretches in both directions, although besting an opponent only gains you ground. Matches arenâ€™t won or lost with a single kill, but with a series of kills granting you right-of-way to run/fight/flee to your own goal-zone.\nEach arena holds different strategic formations and chokepoints to use to your advantage. Until you reach your goal-zone, anything is possible. Only one thing is certain in Nidhogg... the only way to win is to outwit your opponent. En Garde!\n\nNote: Only single player available for this port!",
