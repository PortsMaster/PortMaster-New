By downloading the Knytt Stories Plus source files, you agree with these rules:

* You may...

...create your own Knytt Stories mods or games and release them,
   as long as it's obvious to the player that it's a modified
   version of Knytt Stories, and that the original game can be found at
   http://knytt.ni2.se - so you have to write that somewhere.

...learn and use the Knytt Stories code (mmf2 events) in your own games.

* You may not (unless you ask Nifflas for permission)...

...use the music, graphics, or creatures in other games. Knytt Stories
   is not after all a graphics library, and besides, Nifflas didn't
   create everything in Knytt, so there are more copyright
   holders than Nifflas.

...create entierly new games out of Knytt Stories, unless you replace all
   graphics, all music, and all sounds.

* Important things to remember

Always export .exe's with MMF2 build 243 beta or later. Otherwise
the game will crash on a lot of machines.

If you want to create a smaller challenge, you can make the size
of the .exe very small by removing most of the music and sounds
that won't be in use.

Note that a lot of sounds marked with s_Nifflas_ are not created by
me. Those flags was just intended to mark who "found" the sound, to
make locating sounds easier for me. What it really means, is usually
that I found the sound at the freesound project
( http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/ ), combined it with a few other sounds,
processed, and added to the game.
