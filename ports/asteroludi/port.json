Extract minerals from asteroids by firing your mining laser and fly close to collect them. But be careful not to get too close to large asteroids or enemy ships, as collisions can easily damage or destroy your ship. Sometimes, collisions can be avoided by activating your shields (right shoulder button), but they consume energy quickly.",
