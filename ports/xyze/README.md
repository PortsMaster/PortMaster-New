## Notes

Thanks [Chris](https://chrislsound.itch.io) for creating this gem, and for granting PortMaster permission to distribute the game files.

**The game is free, but you can get some goodies (bonus and SFX packs) if you pay certain amounts -- so, checkout the game page to support this creator.**

ROCKNIX users must run this game with the Panfrost graphics driver (not libMali).
