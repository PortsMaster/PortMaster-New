Hello Mohamed Walid,

My name is <redacted>, and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster (https://portmaster.games/) , and we also have an active Discord server in which you are very welcome to come check out any time. 
We have already ported a nice collection of Gamemaker Studio games to these Linux devices, and we'd love to include your free games as well (https://yousfiwalid.itch.io/)
We've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. However, we at PortMaster, firmly believe in reaching out to content creators/game authors like yourself to ask for consent.
It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include your game assets within our packages. Without your consent, users would have to download your files to add to their ports manually.
Your games would undoubtedly be a superb addition to these handheld devices.
Please note that we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.
Thank you for any consideration that you may lend towards our request!
