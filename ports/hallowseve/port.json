The spirits play tricks, the dead can be seen, and monsters can run their human world errands.\n\nSet in the 90s, play as Ichabod, a pumpkin man who uses his chance to enter the human world to try and rent Jurassic Park from the video store. Unfortunately, the only copy has been rented by a teen who\u2019s brought a witch\u2019s curse upon the town.\n\nGameplay is inspired by the classics and the modern classics \u2014 a Zeldalike sense of exploration, with the tight, fast combat of Hyper Light Drifter. All soaked in a charming pixel art atmosphere and a dumb sense of humor. Playtime is around 1-2 hours.",
