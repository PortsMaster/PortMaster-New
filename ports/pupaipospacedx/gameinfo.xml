    <desc>PuPaiPo Space is a colorful space shoot-em-up in which you travel from Stage to Stage in search of the legendary space pizza. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you will have to battle waves of opponents, dodge hundreds of bullets, pick sweet power ups and face powerful bosses!

Travel through 7 different stages. Jumping from one stage to another requires your space jumping engine to recharge for roughly 90 seconds. During that time you will have to defend yourself from all the opponents in the area and defeat its boss.</desc>
