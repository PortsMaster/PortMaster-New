## Installation
Purchase and download **the full version of the game** from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249480/ExZodiac) or preferably [itch.io](https://pixeljam.itch.io/ex-zodiac). Locate the file *ExZodiac.pck* and drop it in the ports/exzodiac directory next to *override.cfg*.
> [!NOTE]
> This port may not run adequately on low-end devices, and shader compilation during gameplay leads to very profound stuttering.
Commenting out line 6 of *override.cfg* will enable shader preloading, which may potentially reduce stutters at the cost of an egregious load time on the first launch while the game compiles all of its shaders.
