## Notes

This is a game for the whole family. You play cute fluffy little bunnies and hop on each other's heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to let each active player jump over the tree trunk to enter the play area, and then walk to the right. You will then enter the arena. The aim is to jump on the other bunnies' heads.

Network play also possible
