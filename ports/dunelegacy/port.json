The player takes the role of the commander of one of the three interplanetary houses, the Atreides, the Harkonnen or the Ordos, with the objective of wresting control of Arrakis from the other two houses. This port is a build of Dune Legacy, which is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize the game. It is as similar as possible to the original gameplay but integrates modern UI features like selecting multiple units.",
