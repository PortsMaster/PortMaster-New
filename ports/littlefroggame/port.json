Jump around through 3 varied stages to collect flies and beetles, while avoiding enemies and hazards along the way!\n\nAnd don't forget to stay hydrated - froggy will slowly lose hydration and can refresh in small pools of freshwater throughout. But watch out for pits and dark saltwater - saltwater is no good for frogs!\n\nUse the froggy tongue to grab hard to reach collectibles, or activate tongue flingers that will send froggy flying onwards and upwards! Collecting all 5 beetles before finishing each stage will let froggy go to a special bonus stage. There, froggy will find a big delicious dragonfly waiting at the end!",
