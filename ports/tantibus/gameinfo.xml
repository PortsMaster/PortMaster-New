    <desc>A neon lit world filled with nightmare creatures and bizarre situations exists by the name of Tantibus. Journey from your very normal and totally boring home where nothing weird ever happens of Cobble's Key to whatever exists past the first boss.

Be there vomiting gardeners?

Be there depressed lamps?

Be there faceless men?
