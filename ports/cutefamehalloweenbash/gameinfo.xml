    <desc>Spooktober game jam! (2023)

3 Endings. 3 Outcomes. 3 People.

(This. The game that is being played. It is a night of deaths. Deaths that may end with you dying. Be careful, As one wrong choice can lead to your death! But, Time to explain this game, I will call it a party, Since that was the location it had happened. An Halloween party)

This game is a visual novel! Most events in this story were meant to be fiction. Although no research has concluded certain events like this never happened to anyone ever. It is also similarly based off the current "Cute Fame" universe, With changes that make some things feel fresh.
