# Dokimon Quest

## Installation
This port comes with the demo! You can try the game and play up until you're required to leave the first town.

To use the full version, buy the game on Steam or Itch.io and copy all the data to `ports/dokimon/assets`. On first run the game will be patched. If there is an update to the game simply copy the new data to `ports/dokimon/assets` and the patcher will run again.
