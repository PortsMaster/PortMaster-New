Neither concurrent use on two or more computers nor use in a local area

destroyed.  Any such copy of the Game shall include Epic's copyright and
other proprietary notices.  

3.  Licensor's Rights.  You acknowledge and agree that the Game consists

defect in the Game appears, you may return the Game to Epic for either
replacement or, if so elected by Epic, refund of amounts paid by you
under this Agreement.  You agree that the foregoing constitutes your
sole and exclusive remedy for breach by Epic of any warranties made under

THE SOFTWARE CONTAINED THEREIN, ARE LICENSED "AS IS," AND EPIC DISCLAIMS
ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
(WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTY THAT THE GAME WILL FUNCTION IN
CONJUNCTION WITH OR ON ANY COMPUTER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE NOT EXPRESSLY
SUPPORTED BY THE GAME AT THE TIME THIS AGREEMENT FIRST BECOMES EFFECTIVE.

8.  Limitation of Liability.  Epic's cumulative liability to you or any
other party for any loss or damages resulting from any claims, demands,
or actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall not exceed
the license fee paid to Epic for the use of the Game.  In no event shall
Epic be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
exemplary damages or lost profits, even if Epic has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

9.  Trademark.  The names Epic and Epic MegaGames, as well as the names
of the Game or Games licensed hereunder, are valuable registered and/or
unregistered trademarks of Epic.  No right, license, or interest to such

subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of
future breaches.

between the parties.  This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
