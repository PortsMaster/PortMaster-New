The program that generates Bedstead and all of the newly-designed glyphs have been released into the public domain.

I believe that the original SAA5050 bitmap font is essentially in the public domain in the United Kingdom as a result of Section 55 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 as applied by subparagraph 14(5) of Schedule 1. Iâ€™m not a lawyer, though, so this may well be wrong.
