## Notes

Thanks to [Honza VÃ¡vra](https://hvavra.itch.io/) for developing this game and kindly allowing us to host it on PortMaster. If you liked the game, consider supporting him on his page [Itch.io](https://hvavra.itch.io/shards-of-god).

**Note for ROCKNIX:** libMali and Panfrost work, but the cursor resets its position after a few seconds of inactivity using libMali, so Panfrost is recommended.
