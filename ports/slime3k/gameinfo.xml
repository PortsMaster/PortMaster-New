    <desc>A blob of goo, initially used to nourish artificial humans, has become sentient and risen up against its creator—the Despot, an evil AI and the unfortunate ruler of the world in the year 3000! The future is bleak, and humanity is beyond redemption, but at least you have the power to save yourself. Your objective is to kill the required number of enemies displayed on the counter, then find the exit, which looks like a large metallic trapdoor on the floor. To complete the game, you’ll need to clear all levels, with the D’Spot waiting for you at the final one.</desc>
