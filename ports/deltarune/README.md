## Installation
This port works with the following data:

- [LTS DELTARUNE Chapter 1&2 PC Version](https://tobyfox.itch.io/deltarune) on Itch.io/deltarune
- [Deltarune Demo)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/] on Steam by switching to the LTS beta branch
- [Deltarune](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/) on Steam by purchasing the game

Add all files to `ports/deltarune/assets/install`.

## Console Borders
If you are using a widescreen device you may be interested in the [console borders mod](https://gamejolt.com/games/nxrune/629072) which enables the console borders present in the Switch and PS4/PS5 versions of the game. Apply the xdelta patches as the mod's readme states and then copy your data to the assets folder.
