Hi Jack Fox,
My name is (Redacted), and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster, and we also have an active Discord server.

Recently, we've started adding various Godot/GameMaker games to these systems, and we'd love to include your games as well. Although these devices have some limitations with OpenGL, games that use GLES2 and SDL generally run very smoothly.

We've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. However, we firmly believe in reaching out to authors like you to ask for consent.

It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include the .pck in the packages. Without your consent, users would have to download the files from itch.io to add to their ports manually.

Your games would undoubtedly be a superb addition to these handheld devices.

Please note that we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms.

Thank you for considering our request!

Best regards,
(Redacted)

If you're still working on this project that sounds interesting! Yeah I'd be totally cool with that!
