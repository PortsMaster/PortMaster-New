Story :
(or Why On Earth Am I Playing Quake2 As A Teletubby?)

"One day in Teletubby Land, something appeared from far away..."

After his drop-pod was clipped on entry into the atmosphere of Stroggos by Commander 
Bitterman's pod[look at the Q2 intro sequence, I'm being Relevant] Space Marine 
Bolt Rungbelt was knocked off course. With his control systems failing rapidly he 
struggled to stay with his comrades. The blasting of guns and bombs could be heard 
over the whining of the pod's thrusters, and the ground was getting closer every second...

WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOO!!!

Bolt could see that his present course was taking him towards one of the Mission's Targets,
the spinning gyroscope of superconducting rings that was the Black Hole Generator.
As his stricken pod plunged towards the structure he thought "At least I'll blow -something-
up on the way out..."

It was not to be so. The drop-pod entered the Generator's intense dimensionostatic field 
and was gone in a flash of oddly square-shaped sparks...

Thud. Thud. Kchunk.

The pod door opened onto a panorama of rolling green hills scattered with flowers and rabbits.
One such rabbit sat chewing grass at the foot of the smoking pod. It stared at the confused 
Space Marine within for a few seconds with feigned interest before hopping off.
Bolt stepped onto the grass and surveyed the place he had crash-landed.
The rabbit that he had almost fallen on with half a ton of military hardware was utterly 
uninterested in him, but the flower-bed a few meters away seemed utterly terrified.
This was odd.

Space Marine Bolt Rungbelt had been trained for close combat on a hostile planet fighting 
against hideous cyborgs which Nature had disowned, and he had no idea what to do now.
At this point an alien cyborg appeared from behind a hill.
It was yellow and furry.

Bolt considered his options. His weapons seemed to have all gone missing somewhere on his 
trip through space and time, and he'd left his trusty sidearm in the glove compartment 
of his Viper Attack Fighter. Perhaps reason would work?

"Whassat?" said the yellow cyborg pointing a questioning mitten-like hand at the battle-
hardened Space Marine.
"It was a battle-hardened Space Marine," said the Narrator.
"Ib de baddle-dardened spaysmween!" said Laalaa. "Eh-oh!"
At this point Bolt gave up all hope for anything sensible happening, and spent a long time 
just grinning madly at everything.

After spendin time with the Teletubbies, Bolt had pieced together what his situation 
was and had built up a rapport with his hosts.
He was stranded on a world very much like Earth, with four cybernetic organisms which were 
the only specimens of the species they called "Teletubby" that he had seen so far.
They appeared to be descended from a race vastly superior in technology to humanity, but 
untold generations without a need to think for themselves had had it's toll.
They were somewhat simple, to say the least. The only intelligence that Bolt had seen was 
most probably artificial, that of the Voice Trumpets that would occasionally come from the 
ground to instruct his hosts.
For some reason, they were also able to receive and show television transmissions. Odd.

It was at a meal of the Tubbies' staple diet of Tubby Toast and Tubby Custard ("Tastes like... 
Pink?") that Bolt mused over how the Strogg would have been easily defeated if humanity had 
such technology. If only he had access to a Black Hole Generator...
"Blaggole Genrator?"
Bolt was suddenly aware of his hosts rushing from the table over to a recessed door in the side 
of the Tubbytronic Superdome. They returned carrying a pile of burnished blue metal objects 
which they then deposited before him. Tinky Winky, the largest of the 'tubbies, took from the 
pile of equipment a sphere about half a foot in diameter.
"De Blaggole Genrator!" he stated as he adjusted the dials on the sphere's side.

Bolt Rungbelt suddenly found himself where he should have been, standing on the surface of the 
planet Stroggos surrounded by gunfire.
But standing at his side were four heavily armed enthusiasic techno-toddlers.

Model description :
This model is of Laalaa from the great British toddler television series "Teletubbies". 
This series is aimed a preschool children, but is also appreciated by university students. 
They've even appeared on South Park (being watched in a drug-rehabilitation centre, which 
tells you something...) I have included skins for the other teletubbies, but the aerial on 
the model's head is definately Laalaa's. I might do the other's at some point, with matching anims. 
I've tried to make this model's weapon as Tubbytronic-looking as possible and the 
animations are as Teletubbyish as I could get them.
I've added a set of 'tubby sounds, but for some reason I found it difficult to find screams 
of pain and death...
The pain sounds are from the Noo-Noo and Tubby-Custard Machine.

I've made eight skins for the model:

Tinky Winky: Biggest Teletubby, male, bluey purple. Has a red handbag. Bit of an enigma.
Dipsy:       Second largest Teletubby, male, green. Oozes style. Has a big hat.
             The Laalaa animations really don't suit him.
LaaLaa:      Third-largest Teletubby, female, yellow. This model's curly aerial is her's.
	     Very enthusiastic. Has a big orange ball.
Po:          The smallest Teletubby, female, red. Generally agreed to be the cutest.
	     A bit slow, but good in a fight. Has a scooter and mutters in Cantonese.
TT5:         Not quite an official Teletubby, TT5 is a Terminator-style prototype
	     killing-machine-cum-children's-entertainer.
Tubbyzilla:  Like Godzilla, but with ears. And a TV in his stomach. And somewhat shorter.
CTF_B/R:     Just the boring old Capture The Flag skins, red and blue.
	     For a bit of a national rivalry, they've got the red/white and white/blue 
	     crosses of the English and Scottish flags painted on their faces.
	     Could be interesting...
