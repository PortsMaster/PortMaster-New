It's a game where you fly a little plane around the screen and shoot things and drop bombs on enemy targets, and it's meant to be quick and fun.\n\nBig thanks to [Moggers87](https://github.com/moggers87/apricots) for producing this game. \n\nThe [source](https://github.com/moggers87/apricots)",

This is first searched for in ~/.config/apricots/, then the system configuration directory (usually /usr/local/etc or /etc) and finally the default configuration in the data directory.\n\nThe number and type of planes can be varied, along with the airbases, as can 1/2 player game be chosen. The number of anti aircraft guns and scenery can be selected. Draks can be turned on or off, and a different condition for winning the game can be chosen.",
