V) THE STORY

The year is 20,031.  You are Trent Hawkins, a terraformation pilot.  For 
three years, it has been your job to fly over tough-to-navigate planetary 
formations and check for habitable locations on newly terraformed planets. 
You execute more hair raising maneuvers in a day than most League trained 
pilots do during the course of their whole career.  After many years of war, 
however, you prefer blasting rock formations to vaporizing enemy starships.

Your latest assignment from the Interplanetary Council is Tyrian, a proposed 
trading world on the edge of the sector, near Hazudra territory.  The Hazudra 
are a lizard-like race recently discovered in a nearby asteroid field.  One 
of your fellow workers and close friends, Buce Quesillac, was a Huzudra.  
Yesterday Buce was shot in the back by a waiting hoverdrone that 
disappeared into the sky before you could blink, let alone stop it. 

Someone killed your best friend, and if it's the last thing you do, you're 
going to find out why.

The only lead you have is what Buce told you before he died....

"My friend...you must leave Tyrian now, or you will be killed.  Even after 
death, I could not bear to lose you.  Still, what I am about to tell you will 
mark you, so listen well...

You are familiar with the corporation that controls the terraformation of 
Tyrian, called Microsol.  They are responsible for my death.  And, do you 
remember that glowing rock we discovered in the mines west of here?  It was 
more than just a pretty mineral.  It is a new source of power called 
Gravitium.  Harness it, and engines will soon be obsolete.  It can... control 
gravity.  Microsol wants it, and will eliminate anyone who knows of its 
existence.  They captured me two days ago and tried to erase my memory as a 
warning.  They did not know my memory is holographic in nature, and cannot  
be wiped out.  Today I would reason that they discovered this, and found 
me to finish the job.

Now you must go, before they hunt you down.  Hurry!  Head towards Savara, 
the freeworld.  It will be difficult for them to follow you there.  GO!"

You ran to your quarters and found them torn apart.  Luckily you managed to 
obtain three weeks leave and a Gencore Hawk fighter.  You set out for Savara 
tomorrow, and grieve at the thought of telling your parents that your best 
friend has been murdered.  You grieve even further wondering how you're to 
stay alive with the whole of Microsol dogging your heels.

Preparing for a troubled day, you close your eyes at last, vowing to avenge 
Buce's death, not knowing that what will take place in the next three weeks 
will become the legend of Tyrian.

Ready yourself....

UPGRADE SHIP MENU (1-Player Full Game only)

The "Full Game" of Tyrian allows you to customize your ship's weapons and
defenses by buying and upgrading items.  Not only can you configure a ship 
of your own, but you can upgrade to 3 different ships during the game.  Each 
ship has strengths and weaknesses.  There are literally hundreds of 
ship configurations to choose from in Tyrian.

Remember that you need credits to purchase goods.  Your current credit is 
listed below the Armor and Shield bars under the ship display.

Ship Type

In a "Full Game," you begin with the standardized USP Perren Scout ship, 
which is a stripped down fighter craft with less armor than the usual 
Gencore League ships, but it's quite fast.  

At certain spaceports, you will have the opportunity to buy better ships.
Each ship has different Armor and Speed ratings.  These ratings are displayed
below the overhead view of your ship.

To purchase items, select the upgrade menu you want (e.g. Front Gun, Shields, 
etc.) and click on an item.  The first click on the item selects it for 
viewing, and the second click purchases it.     

Front Gun

To select a weapon for your front weapon port, just click on "Front Gun" 
from the Upgrade Ship Menu and take your pick.  

Each weapon has 11 levels of power, so if you have the cash (and the greed), 
use the left/right arrow keys to raise or lower the power of the weapon you 
have selected.  Or use the mouse and click on the arrows below the weapon 
simulator.

Rear Gun 

Each ship also has a rear weapon port.  Choose "Rear Gun" to select a rear 
weapon.  Some rear weapons have two configurations for even more fun!  The 
default key for changing your rear weapon mode during the game is the ENTER 
key.

Like the front weapons, the rear weapons also have 11 levels of power.  Just 
use the mouse and click on the arrows below the weapon simulator to increase 
or decrease the weapon's power.

Shields

Shields are the only things other than your armor keeping huge ionized beams 
from ripping into your ship and turning you into space bacon.  Be sure to 
upgrade them whenever possible.

Generators

Generators power your ship.  They determine how fast you can fire and how 
fast your shields recharge.  A good generator is the key to your offense and 
defense.

Sidekicks

Sidekicks are weapons that fly alongside your ship and provide you with 
additional firepower.  Each ship can have a left and a right Sidekick.  
These weapons range from single shot cannons to plasma storms that can 
devastate entire sectors of a planet.  

For weapons that have unlimited ammunition, simply firing your normal weapon 
also fires your Sidekick.  Sidekicks with that "charge-up" or have limited 
ammunition can be fired separately by using the CTRL and ALT keys.

Done

Returns to the Game Menu.


OPTIONS MENU

From here you can configure various aspects of Tyrian for maximum enjoyment.  
Here are the selections:

Load Game

Loads a game previously saved game. 

Save Game

Saves a game in progress.  The last level you completed is automatically 
saved as a backup game called "Last Game," saved in the last savegame slot.  
If you forget to save, just load the backup game and the last level you 
played will be loaded.

Music/Sound

You can change the music or sound volume with the left/right arrow keys or 
by clicking on the volume level desired with the mouse.

Joystick

With this selection you can recalibrate your joystick and assign different 
functions to each button.  

Keyboard

Allows you to change key functions to customize the keyboard configuration 
to your liking.
 
Quit Game

Ends the current game and returns you to the Title Screen.

Done

Returns you to the Game Menu.


PLAY NEXT LEVEL

Choosing "Play Next Level" takes you to the Nav screen, where you may select 
your next destination.  GET READY!  GET PSYCHED!  And get a holo-snack from 
your ship's bar.  Can't fight a whole fleet on an empty stomach, now can we?


VI) PLAYING TYRIAN 

ONE PLAYER FULL GAME

Once you've selected your preferred equipment of destruction, it's time to 
use it.  Just having a big gun doesn't mean you're a hotshot.  Your enemies 
know how you think.  The only way to beat them is for you to know them just 
as well.  And above all: violence is not the only route to victory.  Study 
your datacubes well.  They contain valuable information that could give you 
the edge you need to conquer the level that you just can't seem to beat. 
Know when you're walking into a death zone and prepare adequately, and you'll 
be one more step ahead... Good luck.

While playing, the screen will show your score on the bottom left.  
Destroying enemies and collecting coins will increase your score.  On the 
right side of the screen your shield and armor levels are displayed along 
with your power level, which will change when you fire.  Your options are 
also listed here, and if they have a limited number of shots the remaining 
ammunition will be displayed.

Collecting Coins                                     
During the game, enemies that you kill will occasionally drop coins.  Years 
ago, an ingenious starship designer developed a metal that, when heated to 
a certain temperature, forms huge metal coins that can be collected by other 
ships.  Council officials scoffed and called the project "something out of 
an ancient electronic game."  Nonetheless, the metal is still used in nearly 
every ship built.

Collect the coins and gems that fall for more credits. 

Datacubes
Datacubes provide valuable information about enemies and levels!  Grab 'em 
if you can!

Power ups
If you see a flashing metal pod emerge from a destroyed ship, grab it. It 
will power up your front or rear weapon from 2 to 5 levels!  If your ship is 
low on armor, a special armor supply ship will appear.  Destroy it and grab 
the armor powerup to repair your ship.

Well, you're on your own from here.  Be sure to destroy everything that 
moves (and in some cases, things that don't) or you're dust. The enemies 
here don't hand out extra lives, either.  Once you're dead, you have the 
opportunity to reconfigure your ship and continue the game.

Enjoy Tyrian, and may your lasers fire true!


ONE PLAYER ARCADE GAME 

If you would like to play Tyrian as a fast and furious arcade shoot 'em up, 
we've included one- and two-player arcade modes for you.  Simply select 
"One Player Arcade" or "Two Player Arcade" from the game select menu after 
hitting "Start New Game" in the Main Menu.

In a one player game you are not be able to upgrade your ship in between 
levels, but instead grab power ups throughout the game.  The arcade game has 
the same number of weapons to choose from as in the normal game.  However, 
even more firepower is obtainable from a "Special Weapon" option.

Power-ups
Front weapon power-ups are characterized by a blue ball with the weapon 
superimposed over the ball.  Power-up the front weapons by getting numerous 
purple power up balls.

Rear weapon power-ups look like red balls with a weapon icon superimposed 
over the ball.  Power-up the rear weapon by grabbing the metal power-ups 
that flash green and red!

Special Weapons
A Special Weapon can be acquired when either one of your weapons is charged 
near FULL capacity.  The small ship indicating your level of power at the 
top left hand corner of the screen reads the number "8" when a weapon is near
full capacity.  Beware, when you are hit you lose power.  

While some of the Special Weapons can be fired continuously, others can only 
be used after they have had enough time to recharge.

There are numerous special weapons...

Attractor: Attracts power ups and coins when you continually 
press the fire button.

Repulsor: Repulses shots when you continually press the fire 
button.

Ice Beam: when you press the fire button you will fire an ice 
shot, which freezes enemies.  Because of their inertia they can still move, 
but will be unable to fire shots. This is especially helpful with bosses, 
but only lasts for a limited amount of time on more powerful enemies.

Super Laser: continually pressing the fire button will release 
a coherent light blast powerful enough to devastate EVERYTHING in its path! 

Pearl Wind: ?

Power of Zinglon: ?

Flare: ? 


TWO PLAYER ARCADE GAME 

Tyrian has TWO PLAYERS capability!  As incredulous as it may sound, 
we've been able to double the amount of wreckage spilled across the screen, 
doubled the huge landscape ripping explosions, and of course, we've doubled 
the firepower. 

The Steel Dragon
Just having double the fun isn't enough, is it?  To complement this 
awesome mode, the first and second player can combine their ships into 150 
tons of deadly space fighter technology.  Called "The Steel Dragon", this 
ship consists of two parts, the "Dragonwing" and the "Dragonhead".  They are 
combined when the ships are close enough together to dock.  This concept was 
developed recently by a new firm, based on the jungle planet of Torm, and 
its name comes from the dragons which thrive there.  Three times as fast and 
hundreds of times more powerful than other fighters, this starship lives up 
to its namesake easily.  

Once combined, the first player has control of all ship movements, and the 
second player controls a special weapon turret that revolves around the 
ship, making up for its lack of speed and larger size.  The ships can be 
separated by one of two means:  Player 1 - holding down one of the Sidekick 
fire buttons and moving away from Player 2, or Player 2 stops firing and 
moves away from player 1.

Power-Ups
During the game, each player grabs power-ups which are dropped from enemies 
that you destroy.  Between the two ships, there are 18 kinds of weapons that 
can be picked up.  The Dragonhead's power-ups are superimposed over a blue 
ball.  The Dragonwing's power ups are shown over a dark red ball.  But, the 
upgrade capabilities of your ship don't stop there...

Your current weapon can be increased in power by grabbing the purple ball 
power-ups.  Also look for the mechanized power ups, which increase the 
other player's weapon by one level of power.

Many strategies are possible to beat tough-to-destroy enemies.  Try 
maneuvering in such a way that you can combine when you need extra firepower 
to destroy a particularly annoying boss.  You may also separate to create 
two targets for enemies to shoot at, making dodging easier.   

Weapons
The first player ship, the Dragonhead can power up with the following
weapons (blue power ups):

Pulse Cannon
Multi Cannon
Mega Cannon
Laser
Zica Super Laser
Proton Blaster
Vulcan Cannon
Lightning Gun
Missile launcher
Heavy Missile launcher

The Dragonhead has no charge capabilities for its weapon, but has a greater 
selection. It is also faster than the Dragonwing.

The second player ship, the Dragonwing, can power up with these weapons 
(dark red power ups):

Starburst
Multi Cannon
Sonic Cannon
Proton Blaster
Wild Cannon
Vulcan Cannon
Heavy Missile Launcher
Mega Pulse Beam

The second player ship's weapon has a special characteristic.  If you do 
not fire, the weapon charges for a much more damaging "super shot" that is 
released when your weapon is fully charged (two small blue balls orbiting 
a large one). The more powered-up your ship is, the faster it charges.
 
There are 11 levels of weapon power, giving you a selection of nearly 200 
different weapons!

Note: Version 2.0 of Tyrian has new weapons!  But we don't want to spoil the
fun of finding them by telling you what they are...


TWO PLAYER MODEM/NETWORK GAME      

What?... You don't have anyone at home to play Tyrian with?  Well, we 
thought of that, and developed modem and network drivers for Tyrian, so you 
can challenge anyone you like, anywhere you like!  Challenge someone you 
don't even know to a battle of Tyrian prowess, or if your friends are too 
far away to visit, simply tell them to meet you on a local BBS and you can 
rock 'n roll in minutes!

To play with two player modem and network support, simply select "Start 
New Game" from the Main Menu.  Then, select "Modem/Network 2-Player Game" 
from the game menu.

Once you have selected the Modem/Network 2-player game, the main Multiplayer 
menu will appear and will give you a number of options.

Playing TYRIAN by Modem

Before you play a modem game for the first time, you need to configure the 
settings to match your hardware by following these simple steps.

1. Choose "Select Modem Brand" from the modem link menu and select the type 
of modem you have from the list.  If your modem is not listed, try selecting 
"Standard 9600" or "Standard 14.4".

2. Choose "Select Speed" to choose your modem speed.  Some, but not all 14.4 
modems may connect at higher baud rates when error correction and data 
compression are disabled.

3. Select "COM Port" to tell TYRIAN which port your modem communicates 
through.

4. Choose "Call a Friend & Begin" or "Wait for a call & Begin" to connect 
with someone via modem. If you choose "Call a Friend & Begin", type in the 
phone number of the person you will be playing against, then press ENTER 
to start the connection.  If you choose "Wait for a call & Begin", your 
modem will go into Answer mode and will pick up the incoming phone call. 
After the modems have connected, you will then be taken to the Epic Challenge 
Arena, which is discussed later in this section.

Playing TYRIAN by a Serial Link

To play Tyrian through a serial link you need two computers that are 
connected by a "Null Modem Cable" that can be purchased from your local 
computer store.

Before you play a serial game for the first time, you need to configure the 
settings to match your hardware by following these simple steps.

1. Choose "Serial Link" from the main Multiplayer menu.
2. Choose "Serial Port" to select which port the null modem cable is connected to.
3. Choose "Serial Speed" to set the speed of the Serial Port.
	We recommend 9600 baud; this is fast enough for TYRIAN to play at 
	its maximum speed.  Faster baud rates may work less reliably on 
	some computers.
6. Choose "Begin Serial Game" to connect the two computers and enter the Epic 
Challenge Arena, which is discussed later in this section.

Playing TYRIAN on an IPX Network

To run Tyrian on any network that supports the IPX network protocol, you 
must first have the proper network drivers loaded in memory before running 
Tyrian.  Check the manual that came with your network software, or ask your 
network manager for help on setting this up.

From the main Multiplayer menu, select "IPX Network" to enter the Epic 
Challenge Arena, which is discussed later in this section.
	
	Note: for some LAN based networks which use multiple network
	segments (hubs), you may need to specify which segments to include
	in the "Advanced Options".  For example, type: -N 1 -N 2 -N 3
	to include hubs 1, 2, and 3.

The Tyrian Challenge Arena

Once you've connected - by modem, serial link, or network - you enter the 
"Challenge Arena."  Enter your name or alias, and you will appear in the 
Challenge Arena.  You will also see the name that the other player has 
chosen.

The Challenge Arena displays information about each player presently 
connected: 

       Name   Your name, of course, or an alias
     Action   Available, Pondering, or Challenging.
    Version   Which version of  Tyrian each player is running. 

Challenge Arena Options:

Challenge: Challenges the highlighted player.

Whisper: Sends a message directly to any other player, so that others don't 
see it.  You can whisper to a player who is playing a game, but your "yells" 
only reach players who are in the arena screen.

Yell: Sends a message to everyone in the challenge arena.

Exit: Returns you to the Main Menu.


VII) THE WORLDS

The following information is all you could gather from your ships databanks. 
Although incomplete, it should give you enough information to begin your 
quest.  Information about the remaining planets can be acquired from 
datacubes that you collect during the game. 

TYRIAN:
Tyrian is the most recent acquisition of Microsol; the sector's largest 
corporation.  Since no single company can own a planet due to Article 17 
of the Interplanetary Council Law, Microsol is responsible for the 
terraformation and trading agreements.  Still, Microsol plans to bend 
Article 17.  It's up to you to stop them.

Tyrian is a world under terraformation, which means Microsol hires work 
teams in the hundreds of thousands to monitor gravity control, land 
sculpturing, and atmospheric maintenance.  Your job has always been to make 
laser measurements of surface features by flying over them at high speeds 
in a land skimmer at altitudes as low as ten feet.  Other team members handle 
atmosphere processors, robotic construction crews, even huge horticultural 
seed ships to plant entire forests in a fraction of the time.  Flying over 
Tyrian, one will notice some rather odd regions.  Floating rock formations 
due to gravity testing, large forests and rocky crags with occasional 
research facilities dot the landscape. 

SAVARA:
Savara, the only free world in the sector, is the only planet totally free 
of the Interstellar Government's policies.  The founders of the planet 
insisted that it be preserved as an agricultural world, and that, with
huge amounts of new plant and animal species, it's natural beauty was too 
important to disturb.  It thrives as a vacation spot as well as an 
excellent trading world, though Tyrian is expected to overshadow it once it 
begins operation.  It is also one of the only planets to support an 
underwater colony.  Huge towers can be seen rising out of the vast oceans 
at certain points.  Savara is an ideal place for trade and repair, however 
Microsol is suspected to have a secret base there despite the mandates that 
outlaw any company craft.

DELIANI:
A triumph of mankind, Deliani's nickname is "TechWorld," due to it's 
sprawling cities and gleaming skyscrapers populating the surface.  Deliani 
is the equivalent of ancient Earth's "New York City,": if one wants 
something, legal or illegal, one usually finds it here.  The economic 
prosperity enjoyed by Deliani is only the sliver lining of the dark cloud of 
crime that exists there.  Even though the planet is the home of Microsol's 
chief competitor, Gencore Tech Alliance, many acts of greed and corruption 
still run rampant.  Gencore was formed not only to restore order to Deliani, 
but to deliberately oppose Microsol in it's sinister dealings.  Those who 
have crossed Microsol usually flee to Deliani to seek refuge with Gencore. 
Beware, flight in Deliani is nerve wracking, due to the tight spaces and 
clusters of towers.

GYGES:
The original headquarters of Microsol.  This planet has a very dry and 
desert-like surface with the occasional mountain range.  Microsol's interest
in this world lies in its weak inner crust, which allows for construction of 
underground research facilities.  Immense domed cities can be seen in major 
research and production locations.  The tragedy of Gyges is that it was 
originally the home of the Zica, an unknown race of alien that originally 
carved immeasurable labyrinthine tunnel systems under the surface.  Microsol 
drove them out, disregarding the rights of an entire race, vaporizing 
entire colonies at a time.  The Zica are feared by xenoscientists.  Xeno-
scientists believe the Zica have fled to the outer reaches of the sector 
where they plan to launch a massive attack on Gyges and Microsol, using 
outer-dimensional technology.  But is it true...?

REMUS:
Sector capital and regional chapter of the Interplanetary Council, Remus 
is one of the largest worlds in the sector.  Remus is surpassed in size only 
by the ice world of Camanis.  Its surface is similar to Savara's, though 
consisting of grasslands and heavily forested mountain regions.  The city 
capital, Portoch, is a metropolis of corruption and dark, rainy days.  The 
buildings are so neglected they are streaked with dirt, providing a 
depressing atmosphere.  It is said that the chapter lords are so decadent 
that they seldom emerge from the local simulation clubs.  The city itself is 
an example of why Microsol holds so much sway in council policies: bribery.
