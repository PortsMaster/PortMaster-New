Each level, the player is required to jump off the bridge, but dying in any other sense, is failure. You may encounter characters that require items, methodical puzzle levels, intensely difficult platforming, tough levels that test your reaction time, and even bosses. Jump Off The Bridge is a meticulously crafted world that avoids the overuse of previously introduced sprites and characters. Every level feels unique, and is memorable.",
