## Installation
You need a copy of [Little Busters!](https://vndb.org/r175) / [Ex Edition](https://vndb.org/r1944). Install the `rlvm` runtime and copy the game files to `ports/littlebusters/gamedata`.

The Steam version will _not_ work!

## Notes
Little Busters has an [English Patch](http://dl.blicky.net/lb/lb-english-6.0.exe) that can be applied to the [Regular Edition](https://vndb.org/r175). Other editions are untested.

This port has some graphical glitches and blank screens during CG events, but all text displays. The baseball minigame is known to not function.
