Beware, however, of any red-colored blocks or packages, and don't let your jump meter run out!!\n\n### TIPS\n- The closer to the bottom of the screen blocks are, the more points they are worth\n- Try holding down the jump button for long jumps!\n- For each GREEN block you slash without jumping you increase your point multiplier (1 block = 1x, 2 blocks = 2x, 3 blocks = 3x, etc). Hitting RED blocks will also kill your multiplier.\n- The best way to rack up big point totals is to slash blocks from UNDERNEATH. Slashing from above will kill your vertical momentum, but slashing from underneath will not!\n\nThis game was made in just under a total of 16 hours for the Amaze Me Game Jam.",
