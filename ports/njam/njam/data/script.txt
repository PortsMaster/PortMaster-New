SHADDY

SHADDY IS A BLIND GHOST. HE JUST MOVES RANDOMLY,
AND OFTEN MAKES TURNS AT CROSSROADS.
HE NEVER TURNS BACK THE SAME WAY HE CAME, EXCEPT
SOMETIMES WHEN HE HITS THE WALL AND FORGETS HIMSELF.

EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLIND, HE CAN FEEL THE PRESENCE OF
SUPERPOWER SO HE WILL RUN LIKE HELL FROM IT, JUST LIKE
THE OTHER GHOSTS DO.

IT IS SAID THAT THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU
IS TO BE HUNTED BY 2 OR 3 SHADDYS. ONLY THE MOST SKILLED
PLAYERS WHO HAVE A LOT OF LUCK CAN SURVIVE THAT.

HUNTER

HUNTER IS THE PURSUIT GHOST. SOMETHING LIKE A GUARD. HE
PATROLS AROUND, AND ALWAYS GOES STRAIGHT, I.E. HE
NEVER TURNS AT CROSS ROADS. IF HUNTER SPOTS YOU, HE WILL
TURN YOUR WAY AT ONCE, AND HUNT YOU DOWN. IF YOU
ARE FAR AWAY, YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HIDE BEHIND
SOME CORNER AND AVOID HIM.

BY EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE HUNTER, HE BECOMES YOUR
FOLLOWER SO YOU CAN USE HIM AS EFFECTIVE WEAPON. HUNTERS
ARE ATTRACTED BY THE NEAREST PLAYER THEY SEE, SO ONE
CAN USE CORNERS TO TEMPORARY HIDE, JUST ENOUGH FOR HUNTER
SEE SOME OTHER PLAYER AND TURN THE OTHER WAY.

ASSASSIN

ASSASSIN IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CREATURE. IT JUST MOVES
AROUND LIKE A SHADDY, BUT IF HE SEES YOU, HE TURNS TO
HUNTER AT ONCE. IF HE LOSES YOU, HE CONTINUES TO RUN
STRAIGHT UNTIL HE HITS THE WALL AND THEN GOES BACK TO
SHADDY MODE.

YOU CAN MAKE ASSASSIN YOUR FOLLOWER TOO, BUT TAKE CARE.

PENTAGRAM

THIS IS WHERE GHOSTS COME OUT FROM.

INACTIVE PENTAGRAM IS COLORED BLACK. WHEN GHOST IS
ABOUT TO CAME OUT OF IT, IT TURNS YELLOW, SO BEWARE.

WANDERING AROUND YELLOW PENTAGRAM IS GENERALLY NOT A
GOOD IDEA, UNLESS YOU HAVE SUPERPOWER ON YOU.

THE DOOR

WHEN THE PLAYER IS KILLED HE LEAVES THE GAME FOR A
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AFTER THAT TIME PASSES HE COMES
BACK, AND ENTERS THE GAME THROUGH THE DOOR. THERE IS
ALWAYS ONE DOOR ON THE SCREEN.

IF THE PLAYER IS SLAMMED BY A TRAP THE DELAY OF
SHOWING UP DOUBLES, SO BE PATIENT.

<P2
JUICE (SUPERPOWER)

WHEN THE PLAYER DRINKS THIS COOL JUICE, HE GAINS
SUPERPOWER WHICH ENABLES HIM TO EAT ANYTHING THAT
MOVES: GHOSTS AND EVEN OTHER PLAYERS.

SUPERPOWER LASTS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND YOU
CAN SEE SMALL NUMBERS 3,2,1,0... AROUND PLAYER AS
SUPERPOWER IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT.

ONE CANNOT EAT ANOTHER PLAYER IF THE OTHER HAS THE
SUPERPOWER, NOR CAN COLLECT ANOTHER JUICE IF HE HAS
SUPERPOWER ACTIVE.

WHEN GHOSTS SEE THE PLAYER WITH SUPERPOWER THEY RUN
AWAY, UNLESS HE IS ALSO INVISIBLE AT THE SAME TIME.

<P3
COOKIE

COOKIES ARE THE GOAL OF THE GAME. EACH COOKIE GIVES
YOU ONE POINT, AND THE PLAYER WITH MOST POINTS IS
THE WINNER.

YOU CAN ALSO GAIN POINTS BY EATING GHOSTS, WHERE
EACH EATEN GHOST GIVES YOU 5 POINTS.

IF PLAYERS HAVE EVEN POINTS, THE GAME IS A DRAW, AND
THERE IS NO WINNER.
-
<P4
FREEZER

THIS CUTE GIZMO FREEZES THE GHOSTS FOR A LIMITED
PERIOD OF TIME. IT LASTS TWICE AS LONG AS SUPERPOWER.

EVEN THOUGH THAT GHOSTS CANNOT MOVE DURING THAT TIME,
THEY CAN STILL EAT YOU, SO BEWARE.
-
<P5
TRAP

TRAP IS A SPOT ON THE GROUND WHERE THE PLAYER CAN
PASS ONLY ONCE. AFTER THAT, THE TRAP CLOSES, AND
WALL SHOWS UP AT THAT PLACE.

YOU MAY TRY TO CLOSE THE TRAP AND GO BACK IN SAME
DIRECTION WHERE YOU CAME FROM, BUT IT MAY KILL YOU.

GHOSTS ARE IMMUNE TO TRAPS, THEY DO NOT ACTIVATE
NEITHER CAN DIE OF IT.

WHEN A TRAP KILLS YOU, YOU ARE DEAD JUST LIKE THE
GHOSTS GOT YOU. ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU DO NOT
LOSE A LIFE AND HAVE TO WAIT TWICE LONGER TO SHOW UP.
-
<P7
INVISIBILITY

AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, YOU ARE INVISIBLE TO GHOSTS.
SINCE SHADDY IS ALREADY BLIND, THIS DOES NOT AFFECT
HIM.

WHEN INVISIBLE, YOU CAN EAT GHOSTS (IF YOU HAVE
SUPERPOWER) EASILY, SINCE THEY WILL NOT RUN AWAY.

INVISIBILITY LASTS THREE TIMES LONGER THAN
SUPERPOWER.
-
<P6
TELEPORT

WHEN A PLAYER WALKS INTO TELEPORT, HE IS MOVED TO
ONE OF THE OTHER TELEPORTS ON SCREEN. TELEPORT
DESTINATION IS CHOSEN RANDOMLY.

THE PLAYER KEEPS HIS DIRECTION, AND KEEPS MOVING,
UNLESS THERE IS AN OBSTACLE IN FRONT OF HIM.

GHOSTS JUST FLY OVER TELEPORTS, SO TELEPORTS CAN
NICELY BE USED TO AVOID GHOSTS WHEN IN DEEP TROUBLE.
