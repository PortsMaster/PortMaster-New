Uncover a far-reaching conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the wolves of the nearby lands.\n\n**Streamlined Combat:** Gone are the days of combo memorization and button mashing. Lugaru uses a context-sensitive combat system to put all the moves at your finger tips. It's up to you to choose the right move at the right time and think your way through the fights.\n\n**Open-Ended Strategy:** Each level presents you with an environment and a series of enemies. How you choose to defeat your adversaries is entirely up to you. Storm in from the front and fight everyone at once or ambush your foes one at a time with stealth attacks.",
