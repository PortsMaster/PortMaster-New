Players control a triangle, rotating it to avoid incoming walls and survive as long as possible. The game introduces mechanics like a 180Â° swap move and curving walls, enhancing the original concept. Its powerful Lua scripting system enables players to create and share custom levels, fostering a community of user-generated content. ",
