## Performance Notes
This port features audio compression in an attempt to reduce memory usage. This is necessary in order for the port to run on the linux arm handhelds targeted. These handhelds are equipped with low-end rockchip or allwinner processors and usually 1-2GB of memory, alongside Mali blob drivers. Low processing power, low memory, and low VRAM are all major things to watch for when running ports on these devices.

## xDelta Patch Notes
For the more technically inclined, here are specific modifications made in order to make FAITH: The Unholy Trinity run smoothly on the targeted devices:

- [GMTools](https://github.com/cdeletre/gmtools) by Cyril Deletre to resample audio at a lower bitrate
- [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) to make some specific changes to the game
    - Compress Textures to save memory.
    - (Steam Version Only) About 50% of steam api function calls did not check if steam was initialized, leading to some math with undefined values which would cause segfaults. Steam API functions are now wrapped in an if statement to verifed that steam is initialized.
