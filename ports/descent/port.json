You'll fly through 3D mazes in search of keycards to gain access to each level's reactor--which, once destroyed, will begin a self-destruct! Make sure you know where the exit hatch is! It will only open when the reactor is destroyed. Oh, and watch out for those virus-infected robots. They'll shoot at you.\n\nIncludes shareware/demo files. See instructions to use full version.",
