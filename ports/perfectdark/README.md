## Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Ryan Dwyer](https://github.com/n64decomp/perfect_dark), [fgsfdsfgs](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) and others for this amazing work, and to fpasteau for the original armhf portmaster version.

# Compilation
An OpenGL library is required to be present for linking purposes, so gl4es is included with the port. However, the binary will fall back on GLES on platforms where that is necessary.

See [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/PortsMaster/PortMaster-New/blob/main/ports/perfectdark/perfectdark/BUILDING.md) for building instructions.
