    <desc>Esote is one of many small towns located within Daedalis's Great Labyrinth, formed years after the Legendary Hero Theseus defeated the awful minotaur. Although Theseus was able to escape the Labyrinth many of the remaining survivors who couldn't had to settle down resigning themselves to forever live trapped within. You (Sophos) have gotten fed up with the defeatist attitude all the townsmen carry on their faces, you hate the solemn and quiet atmosphere that persists day to day. After hearing tales of the Outside from your late parents years ago you decide to go see it for yourself. What is there to fear?</desc>
