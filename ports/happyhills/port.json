    "desc": "Welcome to Happyhills, the town where you can indulge your deepest desires, make your wildest dreams come true, and slaughter anyone in your path. In this case, all three of these are the same. Play as a stylish 80's style slasher and kill your way through different levels. The game offers 20 completely varied levels, each with an entirely different playstyle and way of killing. Do you like a challenge? Don't worry. The game will increase in difficulty with every level, not every victim is as easy as the other. From a simple sleeping man in his armchair to fighting off a gang of bikers in a bar. And don't think for a minute you can carry out these heinous acts without an ambitious detective on your back.",
