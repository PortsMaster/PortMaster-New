Hi Dominaxis Games, 

My name is Jan 'redacted', and I'm part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is named PortMaster, and we also have an active Discord server. 

Recently, we've started adding various Love2D games to these systems, and I'd love to include your game as well. I've observed various homebrew sites simply distributing files without permission. However, I firmly believe in reaching out to authors like you to ask for consent. It would be fantastic if you could grant us permission to include the game assets in our packages. Without your consent, users would have to manually download your game files and add them themselves.

Labyrinth of Legendary Loot would undoubtedly be a superb addition to these handheld devices. Please note, we are not looking to profit or take credit for any of the games. Our primary goal is to introduce more games to our beloved handheld devices, and we're also branching out to other ARM platforms. Thank you for considering our request! 

Best regards, Jan 'redacted'
