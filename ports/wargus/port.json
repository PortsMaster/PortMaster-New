    "inst": "Please read until the end to see which versions are not supported. For the GOG version (2019) copy the setup_warcraft_ii_*.exe and setup_warcraft_ii_*.bin file to /wargus/gamefiles/. For the Warcraft II Battle.net Edition CD (1999) - Copy all the files from the CD into /wargus/gamefiles/ (All files NOT just INSTALL.EXE/MPQ). Then just run the game. This will take longer on first startup to extract the assets (15min to 60min). For the DOS floppy disk version - Copy all the files from the DOS game's data directory into /wargus/gamefiles/ to get the music working download FluidR3_GM.sf2 from https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/ and place it in /wargus/data/. The DOS CD version doesn't seem to work fails with 'INVALID TITLE WITH QUOTES' it may expect the original CD to extract audio tracks - there are some similar issues in the wargus github. WarCraft II Remastered (2024) asset extraction is not supported you must have an older copy of the game. Don't mix sources - if you try with another source backup your saves in conf, delete the wargus directory because the data directory may be tainted and start again.",
