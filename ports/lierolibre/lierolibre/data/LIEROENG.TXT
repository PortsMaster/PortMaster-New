
LIERO
Freeware v1.33

Copyright (C) Mets„nEl„imet 1998, 1999

An earthworm simulation game based on a real physical model.

English documentation is now available!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL STUFF

	Liero is freeware. What that means is that you don't have to pay
	for it and using it has not been restricted in any way. You may
        distribute it to anyone and anyhow WITHOUT ANY CHANGES MADE TO IT'S 
	CONTAINMENTS.

	The source code of this game is not distributed freely (neither
        commercially). So if you thought that maybe you could... forget it. 
	
	Liero is a wormgame with weapons for 2 players. The object of the
	game is definately what you think it is. Liero is excellent for 
	taking out aggression and kicking buddies' butts without any real 
	physical violence or just for having fun.

INTRODUCTION   

	To install Liero, extract LIERO???.ZIP into a directory of its own.
	When you're reading this, it has probably already been done...
	If you replace the files with newer ones, you should remove the old 
        LIERO.DAT, because it's not necessarily compatible with the newer
        version.

        This is the list of the files that should be found after installation:
  	LIERO.EXE	The Game itself
  	KEYSETUP.EXE	The key set-up program
 	LEVEDIT.EXE	The level editor
  	LIERO.CHR	The graphics
  	LIERO.SND	The sound effects
        NAMES.DAT       The list of names for the worms
        LIERO.TXT       The documentation file in Finnish
  	LIEROENG.TXT	This file
  	FILE_ID.DIZ	A description for Bulletin Board Systems

	As you start playing the game, the following files are created:
	LIERO.DAT	Game settings
        *.DAT           Settings file(s) saved by you
	LIERO.OPT	The settings that are loaded while starting 
			the game

	Whenever you quit the game, the name of the .DAT file in use
        is saved to the file LIERO.OPT without the .DAT-definition. Liero
        uses the settings in this file the next time you run it.
	If LIERO.OPT is missing or blank, the game uses LIERO.DAT for
        settings. If it's missing too, the default settings are used. 

	To start the game move to the directory containing the files of 
	Liero and type LIERO. You can also tune up the game with the 
        following switches (type these after "LIERO"):

  	+        	Makes the game run faster (recommended on slower 
			machines)
  	/Sn      	Frameskip, where n is a number 1..5
  	/1Jack	        Sets player 1's name to Jack
  	/2Jill   	Sets player 2's name to Jill
  	/M       	MAP OFF
  	/Bxx     	AMOUNT OF BLOOD, xx% of the default amount
  	/Lname   	LEVELNAME, without the .LEV definition
  	/Txx     	LOADING TIMES, xx% of the default times
  	/N       	No sound 
  	/R1      	Player 1 is a CPU-worm
  	/R2      	"        "  " "   "
  	/Oname   	Uses the file NAME.DAT for settings

	An example:
	  liero /s2 /n /lliero /oyourown
	
	The example sets frameskip to 2, sets the SFX off, uses
        the level LIERO.LEV and the settings in YOUROWN.DAT.

	NAMES.DAT contains a pile of names, from which the names of the worms
	are randomly chosen if the worm hasn't been individually named or
	the name field has been left blank.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNINSTALLING LIERO

        If you want to uninstall Liero, just delete the directory containing
        the files of Liero. Make sure there aren't any important files not
        having anything to do with the game in the directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO PLAY

	Also remember to read the HINTS and GAME TYPES sections.

Weapons

	Before you start playing the worms have to be equipped with the 
	weapons you want. There are 40 weapons in total and you can take 5 
	of them with you on the battlefield. When you've chosen your weapons 
        choose "DONE!" with the "FIRE" button. If you want fully random 
        equipment, choose on "Randomize" with "FIRE".

        You can choose the availability of the weapons from OPTIONS/WEAPON
        OPTIONS in the main menu. 
	There are three options to choose from:
	- Menu:    the weapon can be chosen in the beginning of the game
	- Bonuses: the weapon can only be found in bonus-crates
        - Banned:  the weapon is not in available 

Keys
	Action          Player 1         Player 2         Controllable 
							  weapons

	Move left       D                Left arrow       Turn anticlockwise
	Move right      G                Right arrow      Turn clockwise
	Aim up          R                Up arrow         Increase speed
	Aim down        F                Down arrow       -
        FIRE            left Ctrl        right Ctrl       -
	Change weapon   left Shift       right Alt        -
	Jump            left Alt         right Shift      -

	These are the default keys. You can set your own keys up in the 
	PLAYER OPTIONS.

	While holding the "Change weapon" button down, you can change weapons
        with the "Move left" and "Move right" keys.
	
        The ninja rope is thrown by pressing "Change weapon" + "Jump".
        If you hold "Change weapon" button down, you can adjust the length
        of the rope by "Aim up" and "Aim down" keys. The worm releases
        the rope when you press "Jump".
   
	You can dig by holding e.g. the "Move left" key down and rapidly 
	pressing the "Move right" key. In this case the worm digs left to 
	the direction of the crosshair.

	F12 saves a screen capture into a 320x200 and 256 color PCX file
	with the name "SCREENx.PCX", where x is a number. The compression 
        algorithm hasn't been optimized a bit, so that it is suprisingly slow
	even on 486 machines.

Other stuff
	There are two kinds of objects appearing on the battlefield during 
	battles:
 	- wooden crates which contain a weapon replacing the current weapon 
	  in use
 	- first aid kits which increase health by 10-50% of the maximum level
	If you have a bad luck, the crates may also explode causing damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GAME TYPES

Kill'em All
        Kill or get killed..!!

Game of Tag
        The one who gets killed first becomes "it". Both players have in 
	addition to the kills and lives meters a timer which shows the
        time spent as "it". The	player whose time is running is "it".
	Everytime you die, you become "it", so try to stay alive... When the
	numbers are green you're winning (you've been less time as "it"); 
	when they're red you're losing. 
         
Capture the Flag
        The game goes like this:
        The one who kills the other player first may begin collecting
        flags. As "the collector" you have to take as many flags as you can 
	to your "home base", a little cabin painted with the colour of your
	worm located somewhere on the level. When the collector gets killed
	the other worm becomes the new collector. If you're carrying a flag
	when you die, the flag drops off.

Simple CtF
	A simple game idea: 
	Steal the other worms' flags and and try to avoid being robbed!!
	Apart from "Capture the Flag", in this mode both worms may collect
 	flags at the same time.
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HINTS

	You should learn to dig and use the rope well, these skills are very 
	useful. E.g. if you get stuck, you can dig yourself out. The 
	easiest way to dig is to hold the other "Move" button (the one which 
	points to the way you want to dig to) down and rapidly press the 
	the other one. The rope is very handy when you want to escape quickly
	or just move from a place to another. Also note that the rope also 
        sticks on the worms (pull your friends to you and shoot them 
        with a minigun perhaps, hehheh, they're dead meat...).

        About the weapons:
        When you use weapons that use bouncy ammo (Zimm, Bouncy mine, Bouncy
        larpa) it's worthwhile moving after you've fired. The shots of these
        weapons tend to return to the place they were fired from.

	If you want random weapons without even seeing what you get, hold
        the "FIRE" key down on "Randomize". Then just press the "Up" button.
	
	The tempo of the game can be changed by adjusting the LOADING TIMES,
	e.g. 20% turns the game into pure raging. You can also set 
	LOAD+CHANGE ON from the OPTIONS MENU if you want to change weapons
	while reloading.

	If you want to fine tune you aiming, e.g. get a missile or a bullet
	go through a small tunnel, the crosshair moves way too fast. Hold
	"Up" and "Down" keys down at the same time, pressing the direction
	you want to move the crosshair to _a little_ bit more than the other
	key. Try it and you'll get it.

	It's worthwhile saving different kinds of settings you use to 
	different files, they can be easily restored this way.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS	

When I try to run the game, the text "Runtime error 203 at 0000:xxxx" appears
on the screen. What's the problem?

	You don't have enough free conventional memory. Try to free some
        memory by loading drivers to the upper memory block or removing 
        unnecessary drivers. You can ask for details if you have problems.

Why is Liero so SLOW?

        You've got a slow machine. Try the following:
        - Run the game with "liero /s2". The higher the number, the faster 
          the game runs.
        - Set SCREEN SYNC OFF	
        - Set MAP OFF
        - Set SHADOWS OFF 
        - Decrease the AMOUNT OF BLOOD
        - Set the sounds OFF by running the game with "liero /n"
        - Get yourself a faster machine

USING THE LEVEL EDITOR

	ATTENTION!! The levels created with Levedit 0.2 are not compatible
	with the versions 1.30+ of Liero, and need to be "compiled"
	with Levedit 0.22. Open the level file and re-save it. Similarly
	the levels created with Levedit 0.22 don't work in versions older 
	than 1.30.
	
	Levedit 0.22 is still a very restricted. You can only use it for 
  	placing rocks and empty space, but it can make variety to the 
        randomly generated basic levels. So the editor still needs some more
	work, but maybe this one is good enough for starters.
	
	The level editor starts by typing LEVEDIT in the directory that 
	contains the files of Liero. When you've started the editor, you can 
	choose a tool (empty space/stone) from the upper-left corner of 
	the screen. Drawing the level can be done by clicking the left mouse 
	button. The right mouse button changes the type of stone.

	The key commands of the editor:
	ALT-L   Load a level
	ALT-S   Save the level
	ALT-C   Clear the level
	ESC     Exit the editor 

	Please describe us a good level editor!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE MOST RECENT VERSION

	If a new version is released, it's always found in the MBnet-BBS and
	MBweb (www.mikrobitti.fi).
	On the main level of MBnet type "sis 7" and press Enter. Press Enter
        again and type "ets liero a" (Enter) and all the files having
        something to do with the word "liero" are shown. Liero should be
        found on the list.

	The official Liero homepage still under construction and isn't going 
	to be finished in a loooong time... Maybe there are some unofficial
	Liero-sites already, though.

HISTORY

	This history does not contain versions older than 1.0.

	Legend:
	* change
	+ addition
	- fixed bug
	! other stuff

Version 1.33
        * Ninja rope is traditional again!

Version 1.32
        + A documentation in English!!
        * Some progress with the CPU-player!! It acts very routinely, but
	  is still much better than random :)
        * Duds have been removed (too buggy)
        * Ninja rope:
          * Swinging is easier
          * Limited lenght

Version 1.31
        * Ninja rope is now more realistic!!
        * Gauss gun has been modified a bit
        * Dart has been modified
        * Moving backwards has been removed
        * The CPU-player is now _a bit_ more intelligent... it's not very 
          smart, but better than the random-CPU. It doesn't care about the
          game type.
        - The names weren't saved; fixed 
        - A couple of other bugs have been killed

Version 1.30
        + Gauss Gun
        + Duds: grenades etc. that don't explode 
        * A new kind of ninja rope: it's thrown in the old fashioned way,
	  but the lenght can be adjusted
        * LIEROLOW.EXE has been removed... LIERO.EXE no longer required too 
	  much memory
        - The SHADOWS ON/OFF-bugs have been fixed
        - Laser has been modified

Version 1.29
        * More realistic physics: the velocity of the worm is added to the
	  velocity of the projectile. 
        * The worm backs up if you move backwards while shooting
        * Dart is now faster to reload
        + Booby trap has the name of the weapon it "contains" on it... this
          is what you've been waiting for
        + A new weapon: RB Rampage (Rubber Bullet)
        * LevEdit no longer has restrictions. The levels created with 
	  earlier versions of LevEdit (<0.21) have to be "compiled" by 
	  re-opening and saving. The new file format uses loads more drive 
	  space, but makes it easier to expand in the future.
          
Version 1.28
        ! The memory requirements had increased even though this file told
	  the game needs 550kB... the real amount was 580kB and rarely anyone
	  has that much conventional memory free. Now a smaller LIEROLOW.EXE
	  without SFX is packed with the game, it requires 550kB.

Version 1.27
        - Bugfixes, bugfixes (when, oh when are 'em all eliminated..?)

Version 1.26
        - The worm no longer generates outside the level limits... finally!!
        - Small bugfixes

Version 1.25
        * Mini rockets is now more accurate
        * The worm no longer has to step on Booby trap, Mine etc., they
	  explode from a small distance
        - Bugfixes, e.g. Dart 


Version 1.24
	+ A new weapon: Dart
        + A scrollbar has been added to the LEVEL and WEAPONS menus
        * There can't be two weapons of the same kind chosen in the WEAPONS
          menu except if there are less than five weapons to choose from
        * Blaster has been fixed: no longer explodes when hitting a worm
        * Grasshopper lasts longer
        * Medikits now heal by 10-50%
        * A modification to the CtF modes: now you have to take the flag to
          your home base
        * Changed the names of the game modes
        * Randomizing the names has been changed a bit...
        * The force used to throw objects (such as Grenade) is now 
	  "adjustable". Read the HINTS section!!
        - The former settings did not load for the next game session
        - While loading the settings the colors of the worms weren't changed
	  right
        * When quitting the game the settings are always automatically saved
	  with the name LIERO, NOT replacing the settings in use

Version 1.23
        + A possibility to save the game settings to a file you want!!
	  That means you can create new game types by adjusting the loading
	  times, the availability of weapons, health etc. 
          Packed with the Game comes an example configuration: TAGFLAG.
	  Try it!!

Version 1.22
        - The health meter crashed if health was 10000%

Version 1.21
        - No longer crashes in heavy use!! It has been tested: 2 
	  random-CPU-worms, both with heavy weapons, loading times 0%,
	  99 bonuses, map on, amount of blood 500%, shadows on, health
	  10000%, 999 lives. And the game ran easily 5 hours with these
	  settings...
	  Unstability was caused by a very simple bug.
	  
Version 1.20
        * Missile turns slower (easier to control)
        * The bullets of Rifle and Winchester are faster
        * The laser sighting has been removed from Winchester
        * More animation
        + LOAD+CHANGE-option. When this setting is ON, you can change weapons
	  while loading.
        + The WEAPONS menu:
          + You no longer have to choose the same weapons over and over again
          + Randomize, which randomizes the weapons
            A hint: if you don't want to see the weapons you get, just press
            "FIRE" and then "Up"!!
        + PLAYER OPTIONS, where you can choose your name, amount of health, 
	  the color of your worm and the keys too: KEYSETUP is history
        + A new game type: Flag + Tag
        + Game of Tag: the losing time can now be chosen
        + Capture the Flag: the flags needed to win can now be chosen
        + The mines are now the same color as the terrain (harder to notice)
        - The worm sometimes appeared outside the level (_rarely_)
        - A huge pile of bugfixes

Version 1.19
        + Capture the Flag!!
        + Frameskip, makes the game run faster
        * When you're killed, you can no longer appear next to the other
	  worm or to the place you were killed at
        * Fixed the Missile controls
        - Bugfixes...

Version 1.18
        * The Missile controls have been fixed -> easier to direct
        * You can now use other weapons while reloading!! You still have to
	  have the weapon chosen for reloading it.
        * Larpa explodes when hitting a worm
        * Radioactives have been removed (too efficient)
        * The worm may also regenerate in the sand, creating a fitting hole
        + A new weapon: Grasshopper

          Banned)!!
        * Game of Tag:
          * The timer of "it" no longer runs while the other worm is dead
          * A suicide makes you "it"
          - The timer no longer crashes at 10 minutes
        - Bazooka, Doomsday and Mini Rockets acted in a weird way when they 
	  were blocked by Fan (didn't actually bother)
        - The worm can no longer get stuck on stones!!

Version 1.17
