## Instructions

This download contains the demo build with tons of content (5+ bosses, 90 upgrades, 6 job paths, and more!) but the full version should include more than double that content. This should work out of the box via Portmaster, and if you end up purchasing the full game, you can move `data.win` from the full version into `assets/` and play that version on your device.
