Help Cursy to evade the hungry reptiles, steal the snakes' eggs and prevent them from spawning. \nSneggpit is a charming little arcade game that could have rocked the early eighties - but is brand-new from 2024! While taking some inspiration from all-time classics such as Pacman or Nibbler/Snake, Sneggpit stands out with its unique and highly addictive gameplay and instantly runs on almost any modern device.",
