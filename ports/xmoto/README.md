# Notes

## Menu system
The menu system is designed for 800x600 and larger screens. It will not look perfect on 640x480 screens. However, most menu functions are accessible and this does not affect the game itself, which runs well in 640x480.

# Controls
When creating a profile, the name `Portmaster` will be entered automatically. If you want, you can press `Start + D-pad down` to delete this and enter your name interactively:

| Button        | Action            |
| :-----------  | :---------------- |
| D-pad up/down | Choose character  |
| D-pad right   | Confirm character |
| D-pad left    | Delete character  |
| Start         | Confirm and exit  |
| Select        | Cancel text entry |

To navigate the menus, use the D-pad to select a button and `X` to confirm.  
Or, use the left analog stick to move the mouse cursor, `R1` to click and `R2` to slow the mouse.

In the game:

| Button       | Action                          |

## Online ghost riders
The option to show online ghost riders has been disabled by default, because this often leads to long freezes at the start of levels. This can be re-enabled under `Options -> Ghost -> Enable ghost -> The highscore of the reference room`.
