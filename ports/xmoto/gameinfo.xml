    <desc>Xmoto is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics play an all important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to its limit, if you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of the challenges.

First you'll try just to complete the levels, while later you'll compete with yourself and others, racing against the clock.</desc>
