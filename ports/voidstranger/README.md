# README

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/EzDzzIt/vsaarch64) for this port.
 
This port currently supports **v1.1.3** of the Steam or Itch.io version of the game.

## Instructions

- Purchase game via https://store.steampowered.com/app/2121980/Void_Stranger/ 
- Place all game .png, .dat, .csv, and .win files in the "/gamedata/" folder. 
- On first run, the game will take 20-30 minutes to load. The port is patching the data.win file, compressing audio files, and parsing the .csv game data file. Subsequent launches take 10-20 seconds.
