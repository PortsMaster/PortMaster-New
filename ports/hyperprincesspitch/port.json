Princess Pitch, previously just a sidekick in Garden Gnome Carnage, sets out to put an end to those silly plans.\n\nHyper Princess Pitch is sort of a remake of DOS Operation: Carnage, keeping the fast-paced arcade action, short completion time, high replay value and cheesy characters. Whether you tire of games with moral choices, or you've ever wanted to be made of equal halves explosions and piledrivers, this is the game for you",
