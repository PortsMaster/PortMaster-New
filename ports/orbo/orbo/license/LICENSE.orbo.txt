Thanks for the response, Edgaar!

No -- you wouldn't need to modify them. I can handle any minor patches, controller mappings, that kind of thing. I've already tested some of your games, and they won't be difficult for me to port.

Hi Edgar

My name is Tristan, working on ports for the PortMaster project: https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster

We make various games and ports runable on small Linux handhelds and share them with the community. Recently we've been adding some Godot games and I'd love to include your games as well.

I've seen various homebrew sites just distributing files, but I'd rather ask for permission. Could we have your permission to bundle your games via PortMaster? They'd be fantastic to play on these small handhelds.

Thanks in advance! Tristan
