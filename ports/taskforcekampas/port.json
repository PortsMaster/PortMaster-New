    "desc": "Task Force Kampas is inspired by the Golden Age of japanese shmups, and adds new mechanics, randomly generated levels and handcrafted bosses. It is an endless loop: you can finish it, but also find the way to continue past the ending and get the highest score!\nSpace shooters were never that punchy before. Task Force Kampas emphasizes music and game feel to create the perfect game you'd want to spend all your coins into (if that were still a thing, you know.)\nThe story revolves about a team of outcasts fighting for their future, who happened to be at the worst place during the Evil Invasion. Can you contain the breach? Can you save the whole universe before it becomes corrupted? More importantly, can you save your friends?",
