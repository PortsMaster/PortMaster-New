    <desc>Bad End Theater is a charmingly cruel little story game where everything goes wrong and that’s exactly the point.
You guide a cast of cute-but-doomed characters through branching paths, knowing full well that every choice leads to another terrible ending. The fun comes from experimenting: change one role, replay the story, and watch how fate twists in new, often darkly funny ways.</desc>
