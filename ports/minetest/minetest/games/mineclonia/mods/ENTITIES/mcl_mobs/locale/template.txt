# textdomain: mcl_mobs
Peaceful mode active! No monsters will spawn.=
Remove all, nametagged or tamed mobs within the specified distance or everywhere. When unspecified remove all mobs except tamed and nametagged ones.=
Invalid syntax.=
This allows you to place a single mob.=
Just place it where you want the mob to appear. Animals will spawn tamed, unless you hold down the sneak key while placing. If you place this on a mob spawner, you change the mob it spawns.=
Only peaceful mobs allowed!=
spawn_mob is a chatcommand that allows you to type in the name of a mob without 'typing mobs_mc:' all the time like so; 'spawn_mob spider'. however, there is more you can do with this special command, currently you can edit any number, boolean, and string variable you choose with this format: spawn_mob 'any_mob:var<mobs_variable@=variable_value>:'. any_mob being your mob of choice, mobs_variable being the variable, and variable value being the value of the chosen variable. and example of this format: @n spawn_mob skeleton:var<passive@=true>:@n this would spawn a skeleton that wouldn't attack you. REMEMBER-THIS> when changing a number value always prefix it with 'NUM', example: @n spawn_mob skeleton:var<jump_height@=NUM10>:@n this setting the skelly's jump height to 10. if you want to make multiple changes to a mob, you can, example: @n spawn_mob skeleton:var<passive@=true>::var<jump_height@=NUM10>::var<fly_in@=air>::var<fly@=true>:@n etc.=
