This is one part of a mod to replicate the digging times from Minecraft.  This
part only exposes a function to register digging groups.  The rest of the mod is
implemented and documented in the _mcl_autogroup.

The mod is split up into two parts, mcl_autogroup and _mcl_autogroup.
mcl_autogroup contains the API functions used to register custom digging groups.
_mcl_autogroup contains most of the code.  The leading underscore in the name
"_mcl_autogroup" is used to force Minetest to load that part of the mod as late
as possible.  Minetest loads mods in reverse alphabetical order.
