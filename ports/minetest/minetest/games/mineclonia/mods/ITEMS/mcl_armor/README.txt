[mod] Visible Player Armor [mcl_armor]
======================================

Adds craftable armor that is visible to other players. Each armor item worn contributes to
a player's armor group level making them less vulnerable to some forms of damage.

Armor takes damage when a player is hurt.

This mod is based on 3D Armor mod by stu.
