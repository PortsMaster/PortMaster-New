Settings options are described here: http://doxy.minetest.net/settings.html\n\nSingle-player play requires >1 GB in order to run both the host and client instances. So 1 GB devices should stick to server play because RAM requirements are only ~700 MB. There are public servers available or you can host your own private server!",
