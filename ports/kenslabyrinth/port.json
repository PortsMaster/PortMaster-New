It was programmed by Ken Silverman, who later designed the Build engine used for rendering in 3D Realms's Duke Nukem 3D (1996). \n Ken's Labyrinth is about an ordinary man, heavily implied to be Ken Silverman himself, who wakes up one night to discover that his dog has been kidnapped by aliens. He tags along on their ship and ends up on their homeworld, where he must defeat the murderous creatures and rescue his beloved pet.",
