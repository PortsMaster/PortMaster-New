You have only your senses and the logbooks of deceased crew members to guide you. As you search for ways to expand your arsenal and access to the station, the titular BIOMASS will spread throughout, growing stronger, more aggressive, in a desperate arms race against you. Find out who, what, where and why you are, and uncover the fate of the crew in this doomed lab. Find a way to destroy the BIOMASS and save humanity from certain death.",
