Dear Jan,

From our previous correspondence, I have previously shared the Portmaster project at http://portmaster.games/

From our internal testing, we have gotten Super Crate Box and GUN GODZ working on these arm devices. 

Would you be okay with Portmaster distributing these two games on the platform? The alternative would be to download the games from the relevant places such as steam and placing the assets into the relevant folders. Either way, these are really fun games made by Vlambeer :)

Once again, we are not doing this for any monetary or commercial profits but because we enjoy playing these games on these devices.

Hope to hear from you soon! (And looking forward to ultrabugs too :))

Kind regards,
<Redacted>

Hey <Redacted>, sorry for the slow reply - I was on the road for a couple of days. This sounds great to me, as do the fixes in the previous emails. Just to double check: I assume Vlambeer will be credited for the games and you will not be distributing the source directly? If so this has my ok

All the best,
JW

Dear Jan,

No worries! Yes Vlambeer will be credited for the games most definitely.

There are 2 options:
Portmaster provides the package and user will go to the relevant places such as steam or itch.io to download the game files from there and place it into a folder for the package to patch and run the game on the device
By allowing the distribution of the games, portmaster will distribute the data.win and .ogg files which are downloaded (from steam or itch.io) and patched already and hence users will not need an extra step of downloading files from the relevant places.

The approval to allow us to distribute the games will be option 2.
There will be no source code distributed via Portmaster, only the game files which are needed to run the game on these devices.

Thank you for taking the time to reply and really appreciate your time and the go-ahead to distribute (hopefully)

Kind regards,
<Redacted>
