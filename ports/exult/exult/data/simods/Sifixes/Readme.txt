1	About this document
-----------------------
Author: Marzo Sette Torres Junior
e-mail: marzojr@taskmail.com.br
version: 0.15.12

	This modification fixes a few of the Usecode bugs that plague Ultima VII:
	Serpent Isle. I have tested it *only* with Silver Seed installed; while it
	*might* work without the add-on, I woudn't count on it.

	A potion of the code (the healing of Cantra) is based on Usecode available
	with the Exult source code in the "content/si" directory. I did some minor
	tweaks and some reorganization to make it more compatible with the rest of
	the mod's usecode. I am including it in this mod because many people would
	never know about it otherwise... The healing of Cantra was written by Jeff
	Freedman (aka "DrCode"), and has been split into the files "npcs/cantra.uc"
	and "items/bucketcure.uc".

	Everything else has been my own work, although the structure of the mod is
	based on Alun Bestor's Quests and Iteractions mod. Many fixes were based on
	the document found at "docs/usecode_bugs.txt" on the Exult source.

2	Installing the mod
----------------------
	Note: These instructions are for installing from the zip distribution found
	on my website. If you want to build it yourself, its source code is included
	with Exult's source in the "content/sifixes directory". In it, there is a
	README file with instructions for building it.
	
	First, I must be explicit that I have tested this mod *only* with the Silver
	Seed add-on installed; I don't know if it will work or not without.
	
	Secondly (and just as importantly), this mod is only guaranteed to work on
	*the* latest Exult snapshots. It will *not* work in Exult 1.2.

	With that out of the way: to install the mod, simply unzip the contents of
	the zip file into your Silver Seed's 'mods' folder. By default (that is,
	unless you changed it specifically in your 'Exult.cfg' file), this would be
	the 'mods' subdirectory of the path you set for Silver Seed in your
	'Exult.cfg' file. If the folder is not there, simply create an empty folder
	called 'mods' in your Silver Seed directory and proceed as above.
	
	There is an optional (but highly recommended) additional step you may want
	to perform:
	
	OPTIONAL: You can create a shortcut to start Exult directly in the SI Fixes
	mod. To do so, make sure that the command-line is similar to the following
	example:
		<path to Exult>\Exult --si --mod sifixes
	You can use the supplied 'SIFixes.ico' file for the shortcut (if you use
	Windows) or use the supplied 'SIFixes.png' file to make your own icon for
	other OSes.

3	Contributing to this mod
----------------------------
	If you have any bugs that you would like to see fixed -- or that you *have*
	fixed -- please send them to me! You can either e-mail them to me or you can
	post them in the Exult Phorum.

4	Using it in your own mods
-----------------------------
	You are free to use anything I have written in your own mods; I ask only for
	proper credit -- and maybe tell me about the mod you are doing, as I might
	be interested enough to help and/or to include as a part of this mod.

	In previous releases of this mod, the mod's full source was included in the
	zip file. Starting with version 0.15.04, only the files required to play the
	mod are included. You can obtain the source of the mod in the Exult source
	code, available at the 'Downloads' page or through GitHub.
	It is in the 'content/sifixes' directory.

5	What this mod does
----------------------
	As the title implies, this mod fixes SI usecode bugs. The way that they are
	fixed does not depend on starting a new game -- although if the save game is
	at a late enough part of the game, you will not see some of the fixes.

	Here are the specific bugs that this mod addresses so far:

	- Cantra can be cured of madness.
	- If you prefer 24-hour time, you can have it. Just ask Shamino about 'time'
	  to switch formats.
	- After being cured of insanity, the Companions will thank you for it. They
	  will also join *before* Xenka is summoned.
	- Basement of Temple of Tolerance was mistakenly identified as being "Temple
	  of Logic" by the "Locate" spell.
	- Gwenno can now receive the White Diamond Necklace from Iolo;
	- Gwenno will no longer try to talk to the Avatar when she is resurrected;
	- Shamino will add his own misplaced items in the exchanged item list when
	  he joins;
	- On the same note, the moonsilk stockings and the filari will also appear
	  on that list;
	- Fixed a few bugs on the exchanged item list when you find out the origins
	  of the items. Specifically, the lab apparatus, the fur cap, the bear skull
	  and the plain shield had a few problems.
	- The Pillars in dining hall of Serpent's Fang Keep no longer teleport you
	  to the Test of Purity;
	- After the the Wall of Lights cutscene, you can no longer summon Thoxa to
	  "resurrect" your possessed party. Or rather, you can summon her, but she
	  won't bring Iolo, Dupre and Shamino back as they are the Banes now. Even
	  if you have their bodies right there -- or elsewhere.
	- Dupre can no longer be resurrected after he sacrifices himself.
	- Iolo, Shamino and Dupre will all refuse to leave the party while you are
	  on the Spinebreaker Mountains. They will also refuse any blue potions you
	  offer them while there...
	- The Wall of Lights has been revamped also. There is nothing you can do now
	  to keep the companions out of it -- nothing I can think of, at any rate.
	  Considering that I *have* read the Doug the Eagle's anti-walkthrough from
	  http://www.it-he.org, that is a lot. Also, the companions don't dump every
	  item directly to the ground when they die -- they will intelligently drop
	  it, so that items remain in their respective containers. Not really a bug,
	  but it was extremely annoying...
	- Fixes the Monitor Banquet so that the pikeman from the training area will
	  not disappear anymore.
	- Ghosts no longer talk as the Chaos Hierophant when double-clicked.
	- Fawn Tower is properly cleaned up. Goblins will no longer spawn after it
	  has been cleaned up (unless the banes have been released) and the broken
	  dishes all go away.
	- When you get Dupre's shield back from Luther, you now really give him his
	  shield back. The exchanged item list also registers that.
	- Iolo's lute is no longer duplicated by the Teleport Storm on Fawn; a new
	  ordinary lute will appear instead.
	- Inn keys are now reclaimed by the innkeepers when you are leaving the inn.
	  They will lock the doors and make the beds too. Innkeepers will also drop
	  their inn keys when the banes are released (or, in Simon's case, when he
	  is slain).
	- The Vibrate spell no longer makes you drop the Usecode container, nor its
	  contents, which could break the game.
	- The Firesnake spell finally *works* now! Tell me what you think of it.
	  Just make sure not to stand too close to your target...
	- Spell incantations. In the original SI, there were no less than *four* "Ex
	  Por" spells, and slightly more spells were out of synch with the manual.
	  Moreover, the runes in the spellbook and the runes in the magic scrolls
	  were often at odds with one another, with the spoken incantation, with the
	  manual or any combination of these. The details are:

	    *	Thanks to Neutronium Dragon for the suggestions.
	    %	"Ylem Mani Ex" fits better, but I decided to keep "An Mani Ex".
	    $	Perhaps "Kal Vas In Grav" is a better fit to the spell...
	- Ankh-less sails, as there was no reason the residents would use one of the
	  symbols of Beast British's tyrannical commands.

	- Inn keys are now reclaimed by the innkeepers when you are
	  leaving the inn. They will lock the doors and make the beds too.
	  Innkeepers will also drop inn keys when the banes are released
	  (or, in Simon's case, when he is slain).
	- The Vibrate spell no longer makes you drop the Usecode container,
	  nor its contents.
	- Slightly modified the Firesnake spell.
	- Spells. I took Neutronium Dragon's suggestions for
