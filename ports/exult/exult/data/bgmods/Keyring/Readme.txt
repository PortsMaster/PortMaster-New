1	About this document
-----------------------
Author: Marzo Sette Torres Junior
e-mail: marzojr@yahoo.com
version: 0.11.25

	This mod (the so called "Keyring Mod") contains a lot of small modifications
	to the Ultima 7: Black Gate game WITH the Forge of Virtue add-on. There are
	also a number of not-so-small changes. There is a lot of original usecode
	and art in the mod too.

	There are many acknowledgements I have to make. One is for Team Lazarus; I
	borrowed some ideas for the Shrines and Codex from them.
	
	The other acknowledgements are to those that gave me some useful suggestions
	in the old Phorum thread. They are Crysta the Elf, gruck, Gradilla Dragon,
	Dominus and Artaxerxes.

	I must also thank Crysta the Elf for some graphics she made/edited. The full
	list is in the version history, below.

	Also, I must acknowledge the fact that the structure of the mod is based on
	Alun Bestor's Quests and Iteractions mod, which is included almost entirely.

2	Installing the mod
----------------------
	Note: These instructions are for installing from the zip distribution found
	on my website. If you want to build it yourself, its source code is included
	with Exult's source in the "content/bgkeyring directory". In it, there is a
	README file with instructions for building it.
	
	First, I must be explicit that I have tested this mod *only* with Forge of
	Virtue add-on installed; it will *not* work without that add-on since it
	uses some of the add-on's data.

	Secondly (and just as importantly), this mod is will NOT work in Exult 1.2,
	and neither will work on any but *the* latest snapshots. There were several
	bugs and new features I had to fix to get everything working as is.

	With that out of the way: to install the mod, simply unzip the contents of
	the zip file into your Forge of Virtue's 'mods' folder. By default (that is,
	unless you changed it specifically in your 'Exult.cfg' file), this would be
	the 'mods' subdirectory of the path you set for Forge of Virtue in your
	'Exult.cfg' file. If the folder is not there, simply create an empty folder
	called 'mods' in your Forge of Virtue directory and proceed as above.
	
	There are two optional (but highly recommended) additional steps you might
	want to do:

	OPTIONAL: You can create a shortcut to start Exult directly in the Keyring
	mod. To do so, make sure that the command-line is similar to the following
	example:
		<path to Exult>\Exult --fov --mod Keyring
	You can use the supplied 'Keyring.ico' file for the shortcut (if you use
	Windows) or use the supplied 'Keyring.png' file to make your own icon for
	other OSes.

	OPTIONAL: This mod adds a custom keybinding *patch* file, which alters what
	two key combinations do:
		-- The 'K' key calls the Keyring, like SI;
		-- Again like SI, the 'Alt+K' combination tries all party keys.
	These changes are loaded by default. You can, if you like, edit these new
	key bindings to match your preferences; just edit the 'data/patchkeys.txt'
	file. This file will override your BG settings -- which is why it is such
	a small file -- but only for the Keyring mod.


3	Contributing to this mod
----------------------------
	If you have any bugs that you would like to see fixed -- or that you *have*
	fixed -- please send them to me! You can either e-mail them to me or you can
	post them in the Exult Phorum.

4	Using it in your own mods
-----------------------------
	You are free to use anything I have written in your own mods; I ask only for
	proper credit -- and maybe tell me about the mod you are doing, as I might
	be interested enough to help and/or to include as a part of this mod.

	In previous releases of this mod, the mod's full source was included in the
	zip file. Starting with version 0.11.01, only the files required to play the
	mod are included. You can obtain the source of the mod in the Exult source
	code, available at the 'Downloads' page or through anonymous SVN access.
	It is in the 'content/bgkeyring' directory.

5	What this mod does
----------------------
	The mod started out by adding a keyring to Black Gate. It has two
	new NPCs, several new items and graphics and the following things:
	- You can now meditate at the Shrines of the Virtues.
	- You can now view the Codex; you must be in a sacred quest, though.
	- A brand new Shrine of the Codex, based on the image from the Mysterious
	  Sosaria website.
	- The three items of Principles (Book of Truth, Candle of Love and Bell of
	  Courage), as well as the three Flames of Principles.
	- Lock Lake Cleanup: Once Miranda's bill is signed, the Lake will be slowly
	  and gradually cleaned up of garbage.
	- A brand new Shrine of Spirituality and a new basement for Serpent's Hold,
	  where the Flame of Courage is located. Both are located in a new map, thus
	  using Exult's Multimap support.
	- An improved Orb of the Moons, allowing you to visit the shrines too.
	- Innkeepers will reclaim the room keys when you are leaving the inn. They
	  will also lock the doors and make the beds.
	- The rudiments of a brand-new spellcasting system which allows NPCs to cast
	  spells are now in place. Each NPC has his/her own spellcasting item which
	  can be used to cast spells, and they will use mana and reagents. There are
	  also some new NPC-only spells.
	- The 'Iteractions' mod by Alun Bestor; you can bake pastries, forge swords,
	  milk cows, shear sheep...
	- The 'Avatar Pack' mod by yours truly, with several shiny new portraits for
	  your avatar.
	- NPCs can now cast spells too! The spellcasting system is very rudimentary,
	  being dialog based, but it will get better in the future.
	- Lord British now has his Crown Jewels, based on their Ultima 5 versions.
	  They don't do everything they should yet, but they are unbalanced already
	  if you get your filthy hands on them.
	- A rollable flying carpet you can carry around, which replaces the original
	  flying carpet.

6	Spoilers
------------
	So, you just can't keep away... fine: here they are.
	Proceed at your own peril...

	Keyring Spoilers
	----------------
		- The Quest is started by Zauriel. He is located just outside of  Lord
		  British's castle. You can't miss him :-)
		- Most dialogs have a 'shortcut' out with no ill effects.
		- You must be very powerful to survive the quest.
		- Try hackmoving Laurianna to Zauriel without giving her some blackrock
		  first. Then talk to Zauriel.
		- It is Laurianna that will give you the keyring. She will only do so
		  *after* you give her Zauriel's Journal.
		- Use the keyring on the Avatar to add all party keys to it.

	Shrines of Virtues
	------------------
		- The Shrine of Sacrifice starts out defiled; you can restore it  with
		  the correct Word of Power.
		- Before cleasing the Shrine of Sacrifice, find the "Book of Forgotten
		  Mantras" and take it with you.
		- After you meditate for the right amount of cycles and with the right
		  mantra, each shrine will give you a quest to see the Codex of Ultimate
		  Wisdom. This allows you to go pst the guardians.
		- After going through seven shrines, and if you don't have access to the
		  Shrine of Spirituality, you will be able to attune the white Virtue
		  Stone to the Shrine with the Codex. Be sure to have a way out, or you
		  may be trapped!
		- Returning to the Shrine after seeing the Codex gives you a reward.

	Shrine of the Codex
	-------------------
		- You can only enter if you are in a sacred quest.
		- You must have both lenses to view the Codex. You can double-click the
		  lenses to rotate them.
		- Make sure to carry the lenses with you on your way out -- otherwise,
		  they may be trapped inside the shrine if you can no longer enter!
		- Returning the Items of Principles to their rightful places is always
		  the right thing to do.
		- Try teleporting inside the Shrine and viewing the Codex when you are
		  not on a quest to see it.

	Improved Orb of the Moons
	-------------------------
		- You can now teleport to the Shrines too; just throw the orb far from
		  you. Here are the new destinations of the Orb:
		Honesty                         Compassion                  Valor

		                Moonglow        Britain         Jhelom

		Humility        New Magincia    (Avatar)        Yew         Justice

		                Skara Brae      Trinsic         Minoc

		Spirituality                    Honor                       Sacrifice

	Lock Lake Cleanup
	-----------------
		- Eventually, Mack's key will be in possession of Lord Heather. You can
		  ask him for it.
