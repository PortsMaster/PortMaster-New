    "desc": "Yugioh 2 is a roguelike SRPG based on the Yugioh card game. Before each duel, you spend SOULS to summon monsters to your team, and if you win the match, you either get more monsters or more souls (so you can summon more monsters). Also, more powerful monsters COST more souls to summon, so you need to decide if you want MORE guys or STRONGER guys. The game ends if you win 15 duels (good) or lose 3 duels (bad). Along these duels, you will also face 4 randomly selected bosses from your favorite children's card game.",
