## Installation
Download the Windows or Linux version from Steam or GOG and put all gamedata in `ports/undertale/assets`. You want to copy over the contents of the folder that has all the `.ogg` files. For Windows this is just `/Undertale`, for Linux this is `/Undertale/assets`.

Disclaimer: some translations compatible with latest Steam version were found to be working, but these are mostly untested. Use at your discretion.
